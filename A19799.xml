            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the Heathen <hi>(Right Honourable)</hi> haue ſaid very wiſely and truly, <hi>That we are not borne for our ſelues alone, but that our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, our friends, our cuntrie haue their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and ſeuerall right and intereſt in our natiuitie and birth, ſo farre forth as any way we may be able to profit and doe them good:</hi> then much more ought Christians duely to weigh &amp; conſider, that accordingly as God diuerſly bestoweth vpon them the gifts and graces of his holy ſpirit, ſo are they eſpecially to imploy and vſe them vnto the benefit and instruction of the Church and people of God, and not hide and burie them in the ground, as did the idle and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull ſeruant his talent, as we reade in the Gospell. The cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to remembrance of which most waightie and neuer to be forgotten parable, hath ſtirred me vp from time to time, as leyſure hath bin offered from the duties of my publike charge, to be still occupied about ſome thing, whereby both the Church, and alſo the Common-wealth might in ſome meaſure be benefited and edified. And for both their ſakes and common good, I haue alſo nowe againe bestowed no ſmall paines and labour for the publiſhing of this briefe, plaine, and eaſie Commentarie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the profoundly read, and deepely learned <hi>Danaeus</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the twelue ſmall Prophets (as they are commonly called) to

This worke as it is new, and neuer hath had the like heretofore publiſhed in our Engliſh tongue, ſo I ſuppoſe that in eaſie briefneſſe there is not any of like kinde that can bring vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the well diſpoſed Reader, more ſtore of Chriſtian knowledge and profitable inſtruction, in which reſpect I trust it ſhall come acceptable vnto your HH. &amp; alſo vnto as many of God his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full children as ſhall vouch ſafe the buying and heedfull reading of the ſame.

            <p n="2">2 Secondly whereas <hi>Danaeus</hi> him ſelfe for ſhortnes ſake, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe no text in the expounding of all theſe Prophets verſe by verſe, but onely by quotation referreth thee vnto the ſame, I haue laid downe the engliſh text according vnto ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:9718:4"/>tranſlations extant among vs, as in the iudgem<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>et of the learned are ſuppoſed to goe neereſt vnto the ſame (ſauing that in ſome few places I haue bin bold in ſome one word or twaine to put downe mine owne) for that I deemed that the bare quotation without the text it ſelfe, would ſeeme very raw and little profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto the greater number, vnleſſe it were vnto ſome fewe (if happily any ſuch be to be found) that haue the whole text of every prophet verſe by verſe without booke, and by roote of heart, as commonly we vſe to terme it.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thirdly, where ſoeuer the author him ſelf ſeemeth to ſtand vpon the interpretation of ſome hebrue word diſſonant from the expoſition of others, although he neuer in a maner doe vſe to ſpecifie or name the ſame word; I, notwithſtanding doe vſe in the margin to expreſſe the ſame in latin letters, as well for the vnderſtanding of the moſt ſimple and ignorant, as alſo for that the Hebrew characters or letters are not very riſe with euery Printer, nor their Compoſitors &amp; workmen alwaies very skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the right and true compounding and ordering of the ſame, albeit notwithſtanding they be orderly &amp; truly ſet down in writing vnto their hand before.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Fourthly, all ſuch places of ſcripture, the which <hi>Danaeus</hi> by quotation ſendeth vs vnto (the which in this booke are almoſt infinite) not citing the text of the places themſelues, the ſame ſo neerely as I could find them, and vpon due examination iudge to make fitly for the purpoſe, whereunto they were quoted, I haue truly ſet downe in the text it ſelfe, and ſo farre as my ſmall skill and little learning would ſerue me, haue laboured and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to applie and frame them vnto that which I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be likelieſt to be the ſenſe and meaning of the Author. But howe great cumber and trouble the ſame oftentimes did bring vpon me, as for that not onely the verſe, but ſometimes the chapter, yea &amp; otherwhiles alſo the whole booke was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, I referre vnto all thoſe that ſhall aſſay to make proofe and triall hereof in the Latine coppie it ſelfe of the Author.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Fiftly, whereas this writer beeing a great Schooleman and
<pb facs="tcp:9718:5"/>cunning Artiſt, doth often lay forth the figures of Rhetoricke vſed by the Prophets in their ſeuerall writings and ſermons, when ſoeuer occaſion ſerueth that he doth name any ſuch fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, I doe briefly in the margin make a ſhort deſcription of the ſame, and make it eaſie for the vnderſtanding of the Reader euen of the meanaſt capacitie and conceit by ſome one or two familiar examples, and ſo often as after he maketh recitall of the ſame figure againe in any part of this worke, I doe by quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on referre the Reader whither he ſhall repaire to vnderſtande and know what the ſaid figure is.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Laſt of al, the errours and faults which in the Latin coppy partly through the negligence of the workemen, and partly through ouerſight of the Author himſelfe, doe amount vnto many hundreths, are in this engliſh tranſlation all of them (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they be of any moment or weight) faithfully amended and corrected, ſo that all things are made moſt plaine and eaſie for the drawing on of the courteous Reader to be delighted with the reading of this booke, the which as by me it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hand, and not without great painetaking as wel in riſing earely, ſitting long at it, and going late to bed, that thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt increaſe daily more and more in all Chriſtian and heauenly knowledge, ſo if it ſhal be gently taken, and friendly receiued at thy courteous hands, I ſhall thinke my trauaile well beſtowed, and daily pray vnto God for the increaſe of all needefull giftes and graces of his holy ſpirit for thee according to thy place and calling to his glory, and benefit of his Church and people for Chriſt his ſake our onely Mediatour and redeemer.</p>

Therefore to the ende there might no leſſe teſtimonie be extant of my good will towardes you, then your brother <hi>Edward,</hi> behold right worſhipfull <hi>Syr,</hi> and in all respects moſt noble, I preſent vnto you a ſmall gift, namely my Commentaries vpon the twelue ſmall Prophets, as they call them, the which I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to publiſh and dedicate vnto your Name. For they containe ſuch doctrine,<note place="margin">The doctrine of the ſmall Prophets ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for the Church of God at all times.</note> the which as it hath bin alwaies neceſſarie for the Church of God, ſo is it eſpecially at this time. For that age of the Church was moſt miſerable and full of troubles, whereof in theſe ſmall Prophets there is made mention: the enemies then more dangerous and noyſome, then at any time elſe: the kings both of the Iſraelites, and alſo of the Iewes, were for the moſt part perſecutors of the truth of God and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Prophets, or els mockers of the ſame: there was left in a manner no outward helpe and aide for the godly at the hands of men: nay of the Iſraelites themſelues, and eſpecially of the Iewes (who alone remained of thoſe twelue tribes and ſeede of Iſrael, a people embracing the true knowledge of God) yet I ſay, of the Iewes themſelues many did withſtand the true religion, and preferred earthly goods before hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly: and had their eyes dazeled with the brightnes of the infidelian Monarchies, ſuch as nowe is that of the Turks, and was then of the Aſſyrians and Babylonians: or beeing caried away with the ſweetnes of this earthly peace, choſe rather to ſerue the infidell Princes, then to follow the ſeruice of God. To conclude, in the ende it came to paſſe, that as the dogge can not be driuen from his fattie leather, no more would theſe Iewes afterward be drawne from their blasphemous and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall, but yet for the time quiet and vnto them commodious cuntry of Babylon, albeit they were captiues there, nor could be drawne vnto that ſame promiſed land, the which was vnto them a token of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly inheritance. All which things, when haue they at any time hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened more truly then at this time,<note place="margin">The ſmal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets do ſhew the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God vpon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings vpon the godly.</note> vnto the true Church of God? And out of theſe bookes alſo may we notably learne, what iudgements of God did afterwards enſue, either vpon the enemies of the Church, or vpon the backe-ſliders and forſakers of the worſhip of God, as well Iſraelites as Iewes, people, as Kings: and on the otherſide, what bleſſings of God haue bin ſhewed towards ſuch men as hath bin in deede godly, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God, which made leſſe account of all that they had, and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alſo, then of the glorie of God. What then can be more profitable then this doctrine for euery Christian, or more fit for this time? For albeit your countrey of <hi>England</hi> of all places of the world in a manner alone theſe many yeares,<note place="margin">England.</note> both through the ſingular goodnes of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:9718:7"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:9718:7"/>God, and alſo through the moſt wiſe counſails of Queene Elizabeth, haue remained quiet, and be to be tearmed truly happie: yet hath not it bin without her trubles alſo, or is without for the name of Chriſt. And looke what calamities you doe behold in your neighbour-brethren, the ſame alſo (of your loue towards your brethren) according vnto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Apostle, you doe esteeme and reckon as your owne. But to returne againe vnto our matter in hand, Ierome hath a very notable ſaying, <hi>That we Chriſtians are borne for this end, that we ſhould be made eternall,</hi> and therefore that despiſing the deceitfull promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this world, and all the ſubtile baytes of the Deuill and the fleſh, we ſhould wholly conſecrate and vow our ſelues vnto the true immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and onely wiſe, bleſſed, rich, and almightie God, and his worſhippe and will, which thing is eſpecially taught in theſe books. Iudging ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this doctrine and theſe examples to concerne you chiefely, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the hope of the great good ſeruice to be done in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, whereunto both God himſelfe, by beſtowing of innumerable gifts vpon you, doth ſeeme to cal you, and the which the dignitie of your houſe doth promiſe vnto you, I haue the more willingly dedicated theſe my Commentaries vnto you. For theſe ſhall inſtruct you both vnto true godlines, and alſo the gouernment of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth, &amp; ſhall frame &amp; work you vnto al increaſe of vertue, the which at al times you are to labour for. And to be ſhort, theſe ſhall draw you from euill counſails and examples vnto thoſe that be good and godly. For you knowe that which <hi>Plato</hi> writeth, <hi>lib. 3. de Republ.</hi> That young men of good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes and nature, are eaſily corrupted by euill men,<note place="margin">Plato.</note> and euill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſails, when as they meaſuring others by their own diſpoſition, doe thinke no harme or deceit to be in the counſails of others. And truly the more eaſily that you great and noble men doe liue, the more meete it is, that you ſhould knowe the thinges that are godly and holy. Nowe that your houſe, that is, the houſe of the <hi>Bacons</hi> is most noble,<note place="margin">The houſe of the Bacons.</note> appeareth both by the Engliſh and French histories, in the which there is often made honourable mention of the ſame: and alſo by this, that euen yet nowe at this day there is remaining a most wealthie village in Normandie, as bigge as a great towne, called <hi>Baconvil,</hi> in French <hi>Bacceville,</hi> ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated neere vnto Diepe a ſea towne in France,<note place="margin">Baconvil.</note> the which keepeth ſtill the memorie of your name together with the remnants of a moſt ſtrong castle, and the which both the Frenchmen themſelues, and all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and the thing it ſelfe doth witnes and declare to be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of your moſt noble and honorable familie.

                  <note place="margin">The large ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the word prophet, &amp; propheſying.</note> is very large among the Hebricians. For it comprehendeth all thoſe the which being moved with the ſpirit of God, either or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily or extraordinarily, either in proſe or in verſe doe ſet forth, tell, and declare the will of God, and the ſame either already knowen &amp; written: or as yet hidden &amp; unknown. So the Levites
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9718:9"/>that were Singers are called Prophets, as appeareth in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the 1. Chron. 25. in theſe words:<note place="margin">The finging Levites called prophets.</note> 
                  <hi>So David and the captains of the armie ſeparated for the ministery the ſonnes of Aſaph, &amp; He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, &amp; Ieduthun, who ſhould propheſie with harpes, viols, &amp; cymbals, &amp;c.</hi> Yea moreover the falſe prophets, who although they lie,<note place="margin">Falſe prophets termed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</note> yet profeſſe that they will declare the will of God, are alſo tearmed <hi>Prophetes.</hi> Wherefore it commeth to paſſe, that Paul Titus 1.12.<note place="margin">Epimenides.</note> (ſpeaking of Epimenides of Creta, a prophane man) calleth him a prophet, becauſe he did lively ſet forth the diſpoſition &amp; maners of the men of Creta, and was a moſt ancient poet, as Cicero teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his firſt booke of Divination. And thus becauſe the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a prophet and propheſying is moſt large; the wordes of Paul be theſe: <hi>One of themſelves, even one of their owne prophets ſaid, The Cretians are alwayes lyars, evill beaſtes, ſlow-bellies.</hi>

               <p>There is another diviſion taken from the efficient cauſe of the ſaid diuination or <hi>propheſie,</hi> the which is three fold; namely,<note place="margin">Another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of propheſie.</note> the efficient cauſe properly: the inſtrumentall cauſe: the manner of revelation and action. Nowe the efficient cauſe of divination or <hi>propheſie,</hi> ought properly to be ſaid to be thus; that is to ſay, the efficient cauſe is either God, or ſatan, or the wicked ſpirit, and the devill.

               <p>now the inſtrumentall cauſe of propheſyings was manifold.<note place="margin">The inſtrumen tall cauſe of propheſyings.</note>And of divine propheſyings it was of three ſorts; <hi>viſion, speaking, dreaming,</hi> as in the booke of Num. chap. 12.6. where the Lorde ſaith, <hi>Heare my words, If there be a Prophet of the Lord among you, I will be knowne vnto him by a viſion, and wil ſpeake vnto him by dreame, &amp;c.</hi> But the inſtrumentall cauſe of diveliſh propheſies was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, or in a manner without number.

               <p>Moreover according unto the manner of action or doing, and revelation there are alſo ſundry fortes of <hi>propheſying,</hi> but chiefly two:<note place="margin">Two ſortes of propheſying ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the maner of doing, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> namely madneſſe, or as it were a kinde of diſtraughtneſſe, or a quiet and ſtayed mind of men that foretell things to come. For all the oracles or anſweres of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and of <hi>Delphos</hi> were never given forth by the prophet of <hi>Apollo,</hi> but that he was firſt taken with a furie and madneſſe of minde: the which <hi>

But others, as for example, the prophets of God with a quiet heart and ſtayed minde did foretell things to come: becauſe God did worke in them, and did mildly reveale his will unto them, whom he now will, and then alſo would have of all men to be heard with great attention or heedefulneſſe and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of minde, not as madde perſons, but as his preachers, and moſt wiſe meſſengers and godly men. And that God thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his will the which he would have with heedfulneſſe and reverence to be heard of men, appeareth Zach. 1. ver. 6. where the Lorde thus ſpeaketh:<note place="margin">Teſtimonies ſhewing that the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe declared his will by his prophets.</note>

For ſome of them doe alwaies ſo come to paſſe, &amp; in every reſpect ſo, as they have bin foretold, the which is to be termed a tru prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. As for other propheſies, they are either not at all fulfilled, or leaſt wiſe not in ſuch ſort, nor after ſuch maner, as they haue bin foretolde, the which is called a falſe propheſie.

Some alſo are called deceiving prophets, or lying prophets, of whom hereafter, for that, albeit they do many times tell the truth, yet they do often tell lies &amp; are not ſent of God. Therefore are they deceivers, ſuch as under the goſpell are the prophets of Antichriſt, of whom Paul 2.<note place="margin">Proofes of ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt and his prophets ſhal be falſe prophets and deceivers.</note> Theſſ. 2.9. ſaith, that <hi>his comming is by the working of Satan, with all power &amp; ſignes, &amp; lying wonders, &amp; in all deceiveablenes of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes among them that periſh, &amp;c.</hi> And in the Revel. chap. 20. v. 10. it is ſaid that <hi>the beaſt and the falſe prophets ſhall be tormented day &amp; night for evermore in a lake of fire &amp; brimſtone.</hi> And Peter in his 2. epiſt. cap. 2. v. 1. affirmeth, that <hi>there were falſe prophets alſo among the people, even as there ſhall be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>falſe teachers among you, which privily ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord, that hath bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift damnation.</hi> In the old teſtament thoſe which withſtood the true prophets are

                  <note place="margin">A deſcription of a prophet out of the word of God.</note> which is ſent of God, both to declare his law, and eſpecially alſo to rehearſe and confirme vnto the Church, the promiſes of Chriſt or of the Meſſias the alone and onely Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour of the worlde, which was to come. He therefore for this cauſe, doth foretell vnto the Church things to come, and revealed or opened vnto him of God, both as well to terrifie or feare the ſame from ſinne: and alſo to comfort it beeing afflicted or troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and to ſtay it vp with the hope of peace and reconciliation or favour with God, made and procured by the ſame Meſſias Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. This definition may ſeeme peradventure ſomewhat long, yet is it not withſtanding moſt true.

And therefore is Chriſt him ſelfe called the foundation, or marke that the prophets ayme at, as alſo doe the Apoſtles, as Paul

For they doe very plainly declare, what iudgements of God ſhall come both vpon the Church it ſelfe, and alſo vpon other nations and people of the world, becauſe of their contempt or deſpiſing of the doctrine conteined in the ſame lawe of God, according vnto the revelation made vnto them by God. Hereof commeth it to paſſe, that the bookes of the <hi>Prophets</hi> are full of threatnings,<note place="margin">The prophets full of threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</note> and of the feareful wrath of God prepared and readie againſt the world, as appeareth in Eſa. chap. 13. ver. 17, 18. and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. In Ierem. chap. 25. verſ. 44, 47. and in other places. Amos 1. Zach. 6.7. and in other places: and ſo in the reſt of the prophets alſo. And Paul Rom, 1. 8. ſaith, that <hi>the wrath of God was made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from heaven againſt all vngodlines.</hi> That which at all times by the Prophets of God eſpecially hath beene done. Further, what thinges the promiſed Meſſias ſhould both ſuffer for vs in this world, and with howe great glorie he ſhould afterwardes be crowned, and howe great benefits he ſhould beſtow vpon vs, the ſelfe ſame Prophets of God have clearely foretold, becauſe that they did plainly confirme the promiſes of the Meſſias which was to come. And hereunto doth Peter in his firſt epiſtle chap. 1.10, 11, 12. evidently beare record, writing after this manner, <hi>Of the which ſalvation the Prophets have inquired and ſearched, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of the grace that ſhould come vnto you, ſearching when or what time the ſpirite which testified before of Chriſt which was in them, ſhould declare the ſufferings that ſhould come vnto Chriſt, and the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>the which things the Angels deſire to behold.</hi> Reade more of the ſufferings and glorie of Chriſt, and of the benefites which hereby doe come vnto vs, Eſa. 53.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9718:15"/>Pſal. 22. Hereof it commeth to paſſe, that the ſame books of the Prophets are ſtored and full of moſt excellent comforts,<note place="margin">The bookes of the prophets full of excellent comforts.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did ſhew that God was appeaſed with his Church, by and for the Meſſias even then the redeemer &amp; mediatour of the ſame: nay moreover, according unto the revelation made unto them from God, they did foretell the benefites both earthly and ſpirituall, the which ſhould befall unto the Church to come through the ſame good will and peace of God towards his in Chriſt. That which by the reading of the prophets themſelves may eaſily appeare to every one. Here of is that ſaying of Paul Rom. 15.4. <hi>The things that are written, the ſame doe appertaine to our comfort,</hi> that is, unto the Church that ſhould be after them.</p>
               <p>Now of theſe things is concluded, that the ſelfe ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the which did both expound the law of God, and ſhew the Meſſias that was to come, for the confirmation of both this their doctrine, did foretell things to come by there ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God, of the which foretelling, as the more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful part of their office they are called <hi>prophets,</hi> that is, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellers of things to come:<note place="margin">The office of the Levites and Prieſts ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> &amp; not only <hi>interpreters, expoſitours, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> or <hi>teachers of the law.</hi> For that expounding of the law the which might and ought to be made without the foretelling of things to come, by the comparing or laying of things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether which are like or diſlike, by the proper ſignification of the words, or motion of God, belonged no doubt to the Levites &amp; Prieſtes, the which every Sabbath did teach the ſame law of God in the Synagogues of the Iewes, as it is in Malach. 2.7. where he ſaith, that <hi>the prieſts lippes ſhould preſerve knowledge, and that they ſhould ſeeke the law at his mouth:</hi> for he is the meſſenger of the Lord of hoſtes. And of their ordinarie expounding of the law every ſabbath, there is teſtimony Act. 15.21. where Iames witneſſeth, that <hi>Moſes of old time hath in every citie them that preach him, ſeeing he is read in the ſynagogues every Sabbath day.</hi> But this was an ordinary calling in the Church under the old teſtament like as now under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the office of the paſtors in teaching the ſame Church is perpetuall and ordinary. But the office of the prophets was extraordinarie.<note place="margin">The office of the Prophets extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie.</note> For no man without the extraordinary reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God either then, or at any time was able to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know and foreſhew the things to come, which they foretold.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:9718:15"/>Therefore the Levites in the Synagogues did not foretell any ſuch certen things peculiarly, to come to paſſe afterwardes. Wherfore the <hi>prophets</hi> were extraordinarily called of God, as contrary unto the uſuall manner of the Levites, Scribes, and Prieſts, &amp; beyond their capacity or underſtanding they did teach the people of God. And God did ſet them out with ſuch notes and ſpirituall ornaments, that any man were he never ſo contentious or given to ſtriving, might eaſily be ſure of their calling, albeit extraordinarie, although many times they did neither raiſe up the dead, nor heale diſeaſes, nor ſhew any other miracles, when as they uſed that their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, and came into the open face of the Church. For God did ſufficientlie commend them both by the truth &amp; maieſty of his doctrine, and alſo by the extraordinarie knowledge of his divine or heavenly will,<note place="margin">Notes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his prophets.</note> by the which they were clearly known, even of the moſt way ward &amp; peeviſh, to excell above the capacity or underſtanding of the reſt of the godly, the which taught others alſo. Theſe delivering the wil of God &amp; heavenly doctrine ſound &amp; pure, peaking nothing to pleaſe men, were the ſervants of God and not of men. For albeit they gave reverence unto Magiſtrates and higher powers, &amp; did not deſpiſe them (as the whole popiſh Clergie at this day doth, as Peter 2. Epiſt. cap. 2. v. 10. complaineth of ſome <hi>that walke after the fleſh, in the luſt of uncleanneſſe, and deſpiſe the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which are preſumptuous, and ſtand in their owne conceit, &amp; feare not to speake evill of them that are indigintie</hi>) yet did they not flatter them, or winke at the vices of Magiſtrates and ſpare them. Nay they did ſharply and with great boldneſſe, that is to ſay, liberty of minde reproove all Magiſtrates, as you may read, Iſa. 1. Amos 7. and in Ieremie every where. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of grew this ſaying, <hi>That the prophets of God were to be beleeved,</hi> the which alſo is now true, as Auguſtine teacheth <hi>libr.</hi> 12. <hi>contra Fauſtum Manich. libr.</hi> 4. <hi>Trinitat. cap.</hi> 17. And in the Sentences gathered out of Auguſt. Sentent. 214. For as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe upon the epiſtle of Paul to Titus teacheth, and that verie well, they could not be deceived, as being ſuch as did ſpeake as they were led of the ſpirit of God.</p>
               <p>Now the Prophets which do foretell things to come not being called of God, or promiſe any thing unto the Church,<note place="margin">Prophets not called of God by what names they are termed.</note>

Viſions (as writeth Lactantius lib. 7 chap. 23.) were by the ſpirit of God offered vnto their eyes, and they ſawe them in their ſight, to be as it were done and ended. Whereof commeth to paſſe that they were much mooued with theſe viſions offered vnto them. And how could it be otherwiſe? when as they were but meere and weake men. Yet for all this neither was their minde put out of his ſeate, that they vnderſtood nothing: neither were they as blockes and ſtocks, or onely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue or ſuffering inſtruments and organes of God, the which did but onely vtter the thinges to come, and vnderſtoode not what they ment: that which fell out vnto the prophane prophets.

Now to mingle and confound or huddle up together the things, the which ſhall come to paſſe unto the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, with thoſe things that ſhall fall out unto the reprobates, is plainly to confound God his election with his reprobation, nay to take away both (that is, a chiefe part of the word of God) yea it is to make the ſonnes of God, and the enemies of God all one: it is finally to confound and jumble one with another, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall paines with paines eternall, and to make our adoption, or being choſen into the ſonnes of God, vaine and of none effect. The which is no leſſe blaſphemous then the former.</p>

For theſe fellowes do not as did the true prophets, ſet dovvne the maner it ſelfe, or any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time of the things by them foretold to come: But Broc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card affirming ſome things peculiarly of ſome matter and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, doth altogether overpaſſe the other circumſtances. That which is the propertie of a ſpirite of the devill, turning himſelfe into an Angell of light to deceive withall: and when he hath deceived, ſo cunningly to handle the matter, that he cannot be accuſed of falſhood, becauſe he leaveth out the circumſtances, thee which notwithſtanding the prophets of God do diligently and exactly rehearſe, that it may the better be knowen, when their propheſies had their accompliſhment and fulfilling.</p>
               <p>Fiftly and laſtly (that this my diſcourſe be not without end) This Broccard in moſt of his propheſies hath already bene found to he vaine,<note place="margin">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a worthy queſtion, At what time firſt the prophets of God began to be, and at what time they ceaſed, the which for this cauſe ought not here of vs to be omitted and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed. And firſt to ſpeake briefly of the firſt part of this queſtion: The prophets of God began to be, ever from the beginning of the world, as being ſuch, who both knew the will of God by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and themſelves received from God, and delivered over againe as it were from hand to hand that ſame promiſe of the Meſſias to come, and to ſuffer for the ſaluation of mankinde. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is that the Prophets, the which haue ſpoken of the Church to be redeemed by Chriſt, are ſaide by Zacharie (who himſelfe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:9718:27"/>was a prophet) to have beene from the beginning of the world, that is from all age of the world, and from the firſt making and being of the world, as it is in Luke in his goſped, chap. 1. v. 70. <hi>As he ſpake by the mouth of his holy Prophets, which were ſince the world began.</hi> And Paul writeth that the promiſe of God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning his Sonne the Meſſias and propitiator or atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment maker of the world to come, that it <hi>was knowen and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the prophets before the times of the world,</hi> that is, before any ages of the worlde, or this courſes of yeres, which doth ariſe of the going about of the ſunne, were made, and therefore from the very beginning of this globe or round world, Titus 1.2. <hi>Vnder the hope of eternall life, which God that can not lye hath promiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world began.</hi> That which alſo is confirmed out of the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle unto the Hebrewes cap. 1. verſ. 1. in theſe wordes: <hi>At ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times, and in divers manners God spake in the olde time to the Fathers by the Prophets: In theſe laſt dayes he hath ſpoken vnto vs by his Sonne.</hi> For ſtraight after the creation of the world by God,<note place="margin">The promiſe of the Meſſias fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning.</note> and ſinne committed by the firſt man Adam, the promiſe of the Meſſias was, <hi>I will put enimitie betweene thee</hi> (to wit, Satan) <hi>and betweene the ſeed of the woman, He ſhall breake thine head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele.</hi> Gen. 3.15. the which promiſe at the firſt was made unto Adam in wordes, and delivered as a propheſie, and moſt excellent foretelling of things to come. Afterwards it was declared and expounded by the addition or bringing in of ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For as God commanded ſacrifices to be made unto him by Adam and his ſucceſſours or thoſe that came after him (untill the comming of the Meſſias himſelfe) ſo he did declare the meaning of them: And alſo moreover the ſame will of God concerning the Meſſias to come, was alwaies more clearely opened and ſhewed by other revelations made unto the godly. Whereupon from the very ſelfe lame time propheſies and prophets concerning Chriſt, the iudgement of God to enſue upon the wicked, and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning other matters alſo, and articles of the faith began to be in the worlde, and in the Church of God, that is to ſay, from the very beginning of the world the true prophets of God were, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be. And I make no doubt, but that Adam himſelfe, who talked ſo often with God, who firſt received from him that ſame promiſe of the Meſſias, and diligently delivered it unto his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie,<note place="margin">Adam the chiefe and firſt prophet.</note> who had ſacrifices, and the ſignification of them by God his revelation, (Hebrewes chapt. 11.) vvas a

Hebr. cap. 1. For as without faith in Chriſt there was never any ſaluation, nor any peace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation or friends making an atonement betweene God and men, Heb. 9. ver. 15. <hi>And for this cauſe is he the Mediatour of the new Teſtament, that through death which was for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions, which were in the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

VVhereof it commeth to paſſe, that there was no age, before the comming of Chriſt, in which there were not ſome Prophets, and therefore, that they began to be from the very inſtant of the ſaving of the Church, that is, from the beginning of the world made. That which Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo teacheth. 1. epiſt. 1. chap. verſ. 10, 11. namely that the ſufferings and glorie in Chriſt to come, were declared of the prophets of God by the revelation of the holy ghoſt. The wordes be theſe: <hi>Of the which ſalvation the prophets have inquired and ſearched, which propheſyed of the grace that ſhoulde come unto you, ſearching when or what time the ſpirit which teſtified before of Chriſt, which vvas in them, ſhould declare the ſufferings, that ſhould come unto Chriſt, and the glory that ſhould follovv.</hi> But theſe revelations alwaies in the latter times untill the comming of Chriſt, were more eaſily and fully revealed: but in the firſt times more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely or darkely vnderſtood. And this is mine anſwere unto the firſt part of the former queſtion, when the prophets of God tooke their beginning.</p>

                     </gap>eaſed in the Church.</note> In the ſecond place it is demanded, VVhen the prophets cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Church of God. Vnto the which queſtion, that I may the more plainly make anſwer, I ſay, that of the prophets of God ſome were under the old teſtament, and ſome under the new. VVherefore if the queſtion be of the Prophets of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, I anſwer with the wordes of Chriſt himſelfe, Mat. 11.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9718:28"/>verſe 13. That <hi>the law and the prophets continued untill Iohn the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt:</hi> and from that time ceaſed and had their end. For after that Chriſt the promiſed Meſſias came into the world, and was made manifeſt or ſhewed, as he was by the finger, by Iohn the Baptiſt often pointed vnto, when as Iohn beholding Chriſt walking, ſaid unto his diſciples and unto the people: <hi>This is the Lambe of God which taketh away the ſinne of the world.</hi> Ioh. 1. ver. 29. the olde Teſtament then ceaſed: and therfore the propheſies and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets alſo ceaſed, which did foretell of Chriſt or the Meſſias that was to come in the fleſh, becauſe that nowe hee was alreadie come. For Moſes and the Prophets which were under the law,<note place="margin">The prophets of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When as hee therefore was come and tooke vpon him our fleſh, this kinde of Prophets ceaſed, and new came in their ſtead. Therefore Iohn the Baptiſt him-ſelfe which ſawe with his eyes Chriſt incarnate, or in the fleſh, is ſaid to have beene <hi>more then a Prophet,</hi> Matth. 11. cap. ver. 9. And ſome doe gather out of the writings of the Rabbines, and Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudiſts, that Simeon of whome Luke maketh mention cap. 2. ver. 25. was the laſt of theſe godly prophets of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the Thalmudiſts will have and doe teach, that in this Simeon the ſpirite of Propheſie ceaſed among the Iewes. And they make Rabbi Ionathan who wrote the Chaldee tranſlation and interpretation of the holy Bible, to be of the ſame time with him. Finally they wrote that this Simeon was the diſciple of Hillel. Howſoever it be, the godly prophets of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were onely untill Iohn the Baptiſt. For from him began the kingdome of God and the goſpell, that is, the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Marke the Evangeliſt ſpeaketh cap. 1.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:9718:31"/>bin from the beginning of this world, vntil the comming of Chriſt our Lorde. And this ſhall eaſily be done, if wee deuide the whole time which hath now paſſed from the creation of the worlde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ieſus Chriſt the King and onely ſonne of God, taking fleſh vpon him for vs, unto certaine courſes or ages of times.

Where firſt of all I doe willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that the ſucceſſion of the Prophets, vas not alwaies ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, that it neuer was interrupted or broken off. For whereas this office was extraordinarie in the Church of God, no maruell, if it often ended, or for a time ceaſed for to be: in as much as the ordinarie callings them ſelues (of which ſort was ſacrificing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lawe) did not withſtanding ſometime ceaſe, and were broken off, as in the whole time of their exile and captiuitie in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, and oftentimes elſe. So therfore it came to paſſe, the ſinnes of men deſeruing the ſame, that the Church of God was often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute or voyd of true Prophets, as is gathered out of 1. Sam. 3.1. <hi>And the word of the Lord was precious in thoſe daies: for there was no manifeſt viſion.</hi> And Pſal. 74 9. <hi>We ſee not our ſignes: there is not one Prophet more, nor any with vs that knoweth how long.</hi> Therfore there were then no Prophets, but their ſucceſſion was for the time no doubt of, &amp; the continuation of them broken off. That which no godly man which readeth the holy Scriptures with diligent heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, in my iudgement, will denie. But let vs returne vnto thoſe ſeuen ages of the worlde, which haue paſſed ſince the beginning thereof vnto Chriſt borne of the bleſſed virgin Marie. The firſt of them containeth al that whole time, which was from the making of the world vntil the floud, which fell out in the ſixe 100. yeere of the Patriarch Noah.

Alſo the bookes of Chronicles of the kingdome of Iuda and Iſrael, whereof mention is often made in the bookes of the Kings, is not ſet downe in the holy Scripture. But that Dauid, and Nathan, and Gad were Prophets of God, appeareth 2. Sam. 12. 1. Chron. 29. ver. 29. and cap. 21. Beſides theſe if there were any other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in that age, their names are not rehearſed. For that which is written of Othoniel the Iudge in the third of the Iudges, verſ. 10. and of other Iudges alſo, that the Spirite of God fell vpon them, when as they were called of God extraordinarily vnto that office, this in my iudgement is not to be vnderſtoode of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of propheſie, as if then they became Prophets, that is, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellers of things to come, ſuch as was Iſaias, Ieremias, and others: but it is to be vnderſtoode of the ſpirite of fortitude or ſtrength, whereby they might be able boldly and without feare, to reſiſt and withſtand the enemies of the Church, were they neuer ſo much to be feared. Neither are there any propheſies extant of thoſe Iudges, who after Ioſua gouerned Iſrael as politique Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates in many ages: neither are there any of them reckoned at any time among the Prophets, but among the Magiſtrates of Iſrael. Therefore that which is Hebr. cap. 11. ver. 32. <hi>And what ſhall I more ſay? For the time would be too ſhort for me to teſt of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon, of Barac, of Sampſon, of Iephthe, and Dauid, and Samuel, and the Prophets,</hi> doth not prooue thoſe Iudges to be numbred among the Prophets: but onely among godly men, which by faith ſerued God. For Paul Act. 13. ver. 20. calleth them onely <hi>Kritas,</hi> that is, Iudges, whereas he calleth Samuel (who was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a iudge in Iſrael) a <hi>prophet</hi> alſo. And albeit God, Deu. 18.15. promiſed the Iſraelites, that is, his Church, that it ſhould come to paſſe, that out of it he would raiſe vp Prophets, euen after that Moſes was deade yet was not this rancke and courſe of Prophets ſucceeding one an other continuall, but oftentimes broken off, as <hi>I</hi> haue ſaid.

Therefore 1. Sam. 3. ver. 1. <hi>viſion</hi> and <hi>propheſie</hi> is ſaid to haue bin very rare, and fayling in Iſrael, that is, in the Church and people of God.

But who ſucceeded next after Elizeus the Prophet, is a great queſtion. Wherein I am no we to vnfold the order and courſe of thoſe Prophets,<note place="margin">A great queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which of the prophets ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Elizeus.</note> whoſe writinges in part are extant at this day. For here once againe the ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Prophets ſeemeth to haue beene broken off for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine yeares, becauſe in the worde of God it is no where ſet downe, what Prophets were in Iſrael vnder the kings of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Ioas and Ieroboam his ſonne: or in the kingdome of Iudah alſo (except Zacharias the ſonne of Ioiada) vnder the Queene Athalia, and Ioas king of Iudah the ſonne of Ochoſias. And yet this middle ſpace oftime containeth almoſt fiftie ſeuen yeres, in the which Ioas and Iereboam his ſonne reigned in Iſrael. But all thinges beeing caſt. I finde it to be thus, namely, that vnder this Ieroboam the ſonne of Ioas, and king of Iſrael, was Ionas the Prophet, that ſelfe ſame, whoſe propheſie (by the conſent of all men) is extant,<note place="margin">Jonas ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Elizeus.</note> concerning the ouerthrowing

Finally, to gather the matter into a briefe, Ionas the Gathire ſucceeded the Prophet Elizeus, albeit that then this continuall courſe and ſucceſſion of Prophets were for a time broken off, and for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine yeares,<note place="margin">A doubt who ſucceeded Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas.</note> and were as it were vnioynted. And here ariſeth a greater doubt, who ſucceeded Ionas: I will touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpeake what I thinke, and will not that therefore any man ſhould be abridged of his iudgement. I verily ſuppoſe that Amos ſucceeded next after Ionas.<note place="margin">Amos ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Ionas.</note> Neither doe I thinke, that any great reckoning is to be made, what others haue iudged of the order of the Prophets of the old Teſtament. Firſt for that, as Ierome tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in the preface of his Commentaries vpon Ioel, the Hebrues and the Greekes agree not within themſelues concerning this matter and order. Secondly, becauſe that alſo among the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall or Church-writers them ſelues, looke how many men in a manner there are, ſo many are there opinions, whilſt that they marke not the times, in the which euery Prophet flouriſhed, the which notwithſtanding is ſet downe by all the Prophets them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in a manner. Therefore to rippe vp this whole matter the more deepely for their ſakes that are deſirous of this hiſtorie, it is manifeſt,<note place="margin">The old Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans not ſo much carefull for the order of the Prophets, and why.</note> that the firſt and auncient Chriſtians, which read the the writings of the Prophets, were not much carefull for this order of he the Prophets, either for that by old tradition, it was then ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently knowne in the Church, who ſucceeded each other, that is, what Prophets were firſt, what were latter: either for that, when as they had receiued nothing from the Apoſtles concerning this matter, they did; thinke that they were not hereupon to contend. The twelue Prophets are in deede numbred among the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:9718:35"/>bookes of the holy and ſacred Scripture, as in the Canons of the Apoſtles (as they are called) Canon 85. which is the laſt of all: in the Councell alſo of Laodicea, cap. 58. and in firſt Councell of Carthage, Canon 24. and of Euſeb. Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien. lib. 4. Hiſtor. cap. 26. and Epiphan. <hi>de Menſuris:</hi> but they are not reckoned vp in order, who ſucceeded others. Somewhere this onely is written, that there is one booke of the twelue Prophets; otherwhere, that there are twelue bookes of the twelue Prophets. But why ſhould not the Greekes and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines beeing ſtraungers and Proſelytes among the Hebrewes, be ignorant of theſe thinges, when as the Rabbines them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,<note place="margin">The Rabbines themſelues ſee not downe the order of the prophets exactly</note> and the olde Hebrewes (ſo careleſſe were they of their owne hiſtorie) doe not ſet downe this thing? For Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt. cap. 48. (where no doubt the opinion of the Rabbines of that age is rehearſed) Iſaias is reckoned vp, as he that ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded next after Elizeus. And cap. 49. of the ſame booke, ver. 12. there is onely ſaide to haue beene twelue Prophets: but who they are, or at what time they liued, is not rehearſed, ſuch was the flouthfulneſſe of this learned Hebrewes, yet otherwiſe moſt curious in ſearching out of trifles. In Ioſephus the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,<note place="margin">Joſephus.</note> and alſo a great Hebrewe, of this matter all is whiſt, when as this thing notwithſtanding did eſpecially appertaine vnto the vnfolding of the antiquitie of the Iewiſh nation. And albeit the olde and firſt Chriſtians, as I haue ſaide, haue left vs nothing at all touching this orderly placing of theſe twelue ſmall Prophets, as they are called: yet haue the latter writers afterwardes dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently inquired of this matter. In the which notwithſtanding, as I haue ſhewed, they doe not conſent nor agree within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For Epiphanius in his booke of the Life of the Prophets, doth ſo place the twelue Prophets, of the which we doe nowe ſpeake, (for of the Prophets of whome I haue ſpoken alreadie, there can be no doubt at what time they were,) namely that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeas is the firſt of them twelue in order, then Amos, Micheas,<note place="margin">How Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us placeth the xij. ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</note> Ioel, Abdias, Ionas, Nahum, Abakuk, Sophonias, Aggeus, Zacharias, Malachias, for that Epiphanius had receiued from the opinion of the ſeaventie Interpreters, that they were ſo to be placed, as Ierome ſheweth in his preface vpon Ioel.

Hiſpalenſ. lib. 7.

Out of all which appeareth howe diuerſe the opinion of the Eccleſiaſticall or Church-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hath beene of the order and placing of the XII. Prophets, which are called the ſmall Prophets. And I doubt not but that more alſo may be gathered of the ſtudious and diligent, if a man would ſeeke after the opinion of euery one: but I for ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſake, will be content with theſe, by the which is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, howe that a man is not carefull of this matter in vain, and that hee may without enuie ſet downe and ſhewe his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or iudgement alſo of theſe thinges. Wherefore out of this by path to returne into the way at the length, I ſay that by the conſideration of the times, it ſeemeth vnto me thus, that Amos is to be ſet in the ſecond place, that is after Ionas, becauſe in time he followed next vnto Ionas. Wherein this rule ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally is to be followed of vs,<note place="margin">A rule for the finding of the antiquitie of one Prophet before another.</note> That thoſe Prophets which doe witneſſe that they propheſied vnder the former, or elder Kings, the ſame may alſo be deemed to haue beene former, or more olde and auncient, then thoſe which propheſied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the latter Kings, albeit that the ſame doe often concurie and meete with thoſe other younger ones, and liuce at the ſame time, becauſe that thoſe former Prophets continued long in their office of propheſying. So Oſeas and Iſaias doe liue and propheſie at the ſame time, of the which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding without all doubt Oſeas liued firſt, or beganne to propheſie, and therefore it is to be iudged to be firſt. For Oſeas maketh mention alſo of Ieroboam king of Iſraell, who was the ſonne of Ioas, and witneſſeth that he propheſied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. Nowe this Ieroboam was more auncient then thoſe kings vnder whome Iſaias witneſſeth that hee was, and alſo propheſied. Wherefore in as much as Amos was, and alſo propheſied vnder that ſame Ieroboam King of Iſrael, and ſonne of Ioas, two yeare before the earthquake (which fell into the ſecond yeare of Vzias King of Iudah) it appeareth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9718:37"/>that Amos was in age before him, and therefore more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent then Oſeas,<note place="margin">Amos more ancient then Oſeas and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaias.</note> who notwithſtanding propheſied under the ſame king. Now Oſeas propheſied long after that ſame famous earthquake, and when as Vzias had bene and was now a good while confirmed in his kingdome: in the beginning of which Vzias his raigne, Amos notwithſtanding began to foretel things to come by Gods commaundement. VVherefore this muſt be the order of the xii. Prophets, Ionas, Amos, after Amos I place Oſeas: for Oſeas began to propheſie about the laſt dayes of Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam ſonne of Ioas king of Iſrael,<note place="margin">Oſeas.</note> as appeareth by his owne teſtimonie cap. 1. v. 1. <hi>The word of the Lorde that came vnto Oſeas the ſonne of Beeri, in the dayes of Vzias, Iotham, Achas, and Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah kinges of Iuda, and in the dayes of Ieroboam ſonne of Ioas hing of Jſrael.</hi> And Oſeas propheſied in the kingdome of Iſrael, at the which ſelfe ſame time (albeit he began after him, and were younger then he) propheſied alſo in the kingdome of Iuda that ſame Iſaias, which was of the kings ſtocke. After Oſeas follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in order Micheas, another of the twelve, who propheſied under Ioatham, Achaz, and Ezechias kings of Iuda,<note place="margin">Micheas.</note> before the carrying a way of the ten tribes by the Aſſyrians, Mich. 1. cap. v. 1. <hi>Then worde of the Lorde which came unto Micah the Moraſhite in the dyes of Iothan, Achaz and Hezekiah kings of Iudah, &amp;c.</hi> And Ieremy alſo maketh mention of his propheſying under Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah cap. 26. v. 18. in theſe wordes, <hi>Micah the Moraſhite prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in the dayes of Hezekiah king of Iudah, &amp;c.</hi> And theſe ſo many Prophets had this fift age, that is to ſay, theſe which follow, and which are, Nathan, Ahias the Silonite, Semeias, Iadi, Addo, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, Azarias, Anani, Iehu, Elias, Micheas the firſt, Elizaerus, Ionas, Amos, Oſeas, Iſaias, Micheas the ſecond, or the Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhite, beſides thoſe that are not named by their proper names in the holy ſcripture.</p>
               <p>The ſixt age now followeth: and the ſame continueth from the carrying away of the ten Tribes (which were the kingdome of Iſrael) made by Salmanazar king of the Aſſyrians,<note place="margin">The ſixt age fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the carying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the ten Tribes untill the full captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Babylon <hi>133.</hi> yeres had theſe prophets.</note> untill the times of the full captivitie of Babylon, the which happened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdom of Iuda (to wit, after the overthrow of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Iſrael) namely when as the Iewes with their king Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekias were wholly carried unto Babylon and Media by Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar Emperour of the Babylonians: and not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne to be carried away. For they beganne to be carried away
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:9718:38"/>vnder Ioacim king of the Iewes, 18 yeres before their full and through captivity. This ſixt age containeth 133 yeeres. For ſo much ſpace of time paſſed betweene the ten tribes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Iſrael carried away by the Aſſyrians, and that full cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie of the Iewes made by the king of Babylon, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the continuall ſucceſſion of the kings of Iudah 2. King. 17.18. cap. and ſo foorth. For the firſt captivitie or carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the Iewes by the Babylonians beganne, in the reigne of Ioacim ſonne of Ioſias, having reigned now 4 yeres, as I haue ſaide already and appeareth Matth. 1. cap. ver. 11. and in the firſt yeere of the Empire of Nabuchadnezzar Dan. 1. verſ. 1. And the laſt or full captivitie fell out vnder Sedechias the king having reigned no we eleven yeres. In this age the Prophets ſo ſucceeded one another, that there ſeemeth to have beene no interruption or breaking off. For the prophets of God which lived in this ninth time, ſucceeded next vnto Micheas the Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhite. And the firſt of them in my iudgement, and ſo farre as I can gather, all things beeing conſidered, was Nahum. For he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto me to haue beene,<note place="margin">Nahum.</note> and to have propheſied next after Micheas, and after the carrying away of the ten Tribes of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el by the Aſſyrians, to wit, vnder die king Ezechias, when as yet now the Empire of the Aſſyrians floriſhed in all reſpects, and no man so much as once durſt by dreame to thinke of the fall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: yea finally when as hitherto it had felt no hurt from any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and as yet had not growen into contempt, the which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding happened vnto his Empire aftervvard, to wit, vnder Sennacherib who ſucceeded Salmanazar. For under him firſt of all the Aſſyrians received that great overthrow, at the beſieging of the city of Ieruſalem, of the which mention is made by Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as cap. 37. ver. 36. to wit, how the <hi>Angell of the Lord went out, and ſmote in the campe of Aſhur an hundreth, foure ſcore, and five thouſand, &amp;c.</hi> At which time the Emperour of the Aſſyrians firſt doubtleſſe began to waxe vile and to be contemned or deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of his ſubiects. And of this his overthrow, and loſſe for to come propheſied Naum: alſo cap. 1. ver. 14. in theſe wordes. <hi>And the Lord hath gîven a commandement concerning thee, that n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I will make it thy grave for thee: for thou art vile.</hi> Therfore after this overthrow, the people that were ſubiect vnto the Aſſyrians, and eſpecially the Babylonians or
<pb facs="tcp:9718:38"/>Chaldeans began to lift up themſelves into a kingdome of their owne, and to fall away from the Aſſyrians. <hi>A</hi> proofe whereof is this, for that under Salmanazar king of the Aſſyrians, the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians are reckened vp as wholly ſubiect unto the Aſſyrians, and vvithout any king of their owne, 2. king. cap. 17. ver. 24. where we read thus: <hi>And the king of Aſhur brought folke from Babel</hi> (by vvhich it may appeare that Babylon was then ſubiect unto the Aſſyrians) <hi>and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamah, and from Sepharhaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria in ſtead of the children of Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> But after that ſame great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, the vvhich Sennacherib king of the Aſſyrians, and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour unto Salmanazar received in Iudea, the ſame Babylonians are rehearſed, as thoſe who had novv a king of their ovvne, and did ſeeke and ſue for the fellovvſhip and friendſhip of other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which were enemies unto the Aſſyrians, Iſai. cap. 13. ver. 1. <hi>At the ſametime Merodach Baladan, the ſonne of Babadan king of Babel</hi> (novv Babylon hath a king of her ovvne) <hi>ſent letters and a preſent unto Hezekiah, &amp;c.</hi> Out of vvhich appeareth that vvhich wee haue ſaide, that the Aſſyrian Empire began firſt to fall to decay under king Sennacherib, and to grovve into contempt among men, ſo that novv all men might eaſily thinke upon the mine of the ſame. But that the ſame ſhould come to paſſe, Nahum by revelation from God had foreſhevved before this time. For what matter of great importance had it beene,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nahum</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſied of the ruine of Aſſyria.</note> or neede of any eſpeciall propheſie to ſhevve unto the Aſſyrians their deſtruction then, that is to ſay, when as all men of by reaſon of that overthrow vvhich before they had received, might eaſily geſſe, and by vviſe coniecture gather that the ſame vvoulde by and by inſue. VVherefore every one not given to contende, may novv eaſily underſtand, at vvhat time Nahum propheſied. Namely in that middle ſpace of time, vvhich paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed betvveene the carrying away of the ten Tribes by Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nazar and the deſtruction or overthrovv of the hoſt of Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib. And this is the ſpace of 8. yeres under the reigne of Ezechias. So then Nahum propheſied in the dayes of Ezechias king of Iudah, from the ſeventh yeere of his reigne unto the fourteenth yeere, as may be gathered by the 2. King cap. 18. verſ 10, and 13. Next after Nahum propheſieth Ieremie, namely the thirteenth yeere of the ſame Ezechias, as hee him ſelfe doth clearely ſhevve, chap. the firſt, verſe the ſecond,<note place="margin">Ieremie.</note> vvhere he ſaieth

Iſai. 8.1, 2. &amp; 16. But to make an end at the laſt of this matter, it doeth no where better appeare that this was uſed to be done, then out of the book of the prophet Ieremie. For as it appeareth by the 26. chap. v. 7, 8, &amp; 16.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ieremie.</hi> Read the whole <hi>26.</hi> and <hi>36.</hi> chapters.</note> Ieremie doeth openly often times utter the doctrine told him from God, to wit, in the audience of all the people. And the prieſts of that time doe utterly condemne his words and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and do think them to be aboliſhed or done away, much leſſe that they would lay them up in the treaſury of the Temple. Nay morvover, Iehudi the purple or gallant Courtier of the king Sede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias doth burne thoſe oracles or ſayings of God, after that they were written by Ieremie him ſelfe. Iere. 36.23. but by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God and Ieremie telling him what to write the ſecond time, the ſelfe ſame things are written againe by Baruch his miniſter, as in the ſame chapter appeareth. The like may any man eaſily gather out of the ſame Ieremy cap. 29. Out of Ezec. cap. 12. &amp; 14. Finally, thus the Apoſtles, as Paul, Peter, and the Evangeliſts, Matthew, Iohn, Marke, and Luke, have left unto us their writing, the which are another part of the word of God. For this their doctrine the which they afterward put in writing, they did firſt along time and often utter by mouth, and then wrote it, and imparted it unto nations unto the everlaſting glory of God, and edifying of his Church. And this in my iudgement was the uſe, maner, and way of gathering together of the books and writings of the prophets.</p>

But as concerning the things which appertaine into the former age, they receive either none at all, or elſe very ſmall light from the prophane Hiſtoriographers, I meane Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus, Diodorus, Siculus, Xenophon, and ſuch other like.

Wherefore in this place I take the word <hi>mercie,</hi> for the effects of mercie, the which God being mercifull, beſtoweth vpon men.

Iohn 21.17. where Chriſt ſaith unto him the third time: <hi>Simon the ſonne of Iona, lovest thou me?</hi> Peter was ſory becauſe he ſaid unto him the third time, <hi>loveſt thou me:</hi> and ſaid unto him, <hi>Lord, Thou knowest all thinges, thou knoweſt that I love thee. Then Ieſus ſaide unto him, Feede my ſheepe.</hi> Now if Ionas had not had this commiſſion renewed, hee neither ought nor could have gone to Ninive, and followe that firſt commavndement, the which ſeemed through Ionas his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, by God himſelfe to have bene revoked, or called back. Further, theſe things were done by Ionas, at the leaſt under Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam the ſonne of Ioas king of Iſrael, under whome he lived, at what time the power of the Aſſyrians was now knowen unto the Iſraelites: but as yet not feared of them.

For God ſaid unto him before, verſ. 2. <hi>Ariſe, goe to Ninive:</hi> and here it is ſaide, <hi>He aroſe, and went to Ninive according unto the word of the Lord,</hi> that Ionas may ſhew himſelfe now to haue bene ready to obey, and not to be reſiſting, diſobedient, and running away, as he was before. So ought we to obey God both faithfully, and alſo readily. And for the truth of the hiſtory, and to teſtifie or witneſſe his obedience, he deſcribeth Ninive, to ſhew that he came into the ſelfe ſame city, and that he told the ſelfe ſame things, the which God had commaunded him: that is to ſay, hee came unto that ſame very great city Ninive, <note place="margin">The greatnes of Ninive.</note> the which as Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus lib. 3. cap. 1. doe affirme, was more then 30.

The repentance therefore of Ionas was true. Further, why this citie Ninive was ſo great, the reaſon is, for that before the Empire of the Macedonians, thoſe countreyes were inhabited onely by ſtreetes: and there were very few cities in them, as ſaith Plinie libr. 6.

Touching the faith of the Ninivites:
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:9718:71"/>they are ſaide to have beleeved God, that is to ſay, the prophet Ionas in the name of God denouncing or ſhewing unto them theſe threatnings becauſe of their wickedneſſe. <note place="margin">

For after thoſe 40. daies it came to paſſe that Ionas complained grievouſly with himſelfe becauſe that the Ninivites were ſpared, and was moſt exceeding angry.</p>
                     <p>This verſe then conteineth two things. Firſt his diſſenting or diſagreeing from the will of God: ſecondly his anger upon this diſagreeing, nay his burning and great boyling in minde, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God I confeſſe (for that had bene the part of a man utterly wicked, ſuch a one as Ionas was not) but within himſelfe taking it grievouſly, for that the matter and iſſue of his preaching, did not ſo fall out, as he hoped it would do, and as he thought it to be meet for the glory of God, &amp; for the commending of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the miniſterie propheticall, and his eſpecially among the Gentiles, and men that were ſcorners of the God of Iſrael. This man therefore did fret within himſelfe, &amp; did chafe in his minde, (but not againſt God, accuſing him of lying or falſhood, or blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming his name) but preferring the iudgement of his owne mind concerning the eſtabliſhing of the God of Iſraels power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen, &amp; the certentie of his word among men that were infidels, before that counſell of the wiſdome of God, and alſo before ſo notable a fruite of his miniſtery or office. VVhereby doubtles doth appeare evidently the power &amp; feare of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God of Iſrael even among the Heathen themſelves, whilſt they in ſuch ſort give eare unto &amp; receive his prophet, whom they had never ſeene before, &amp; one that was not famous among them by any miracles there wrought, <note place="margin">Two cauſes of Jonas his anger and as it were, ſaucineſſe to chide with God. <hi>1</hi>
                        </note> &amp; do beleeve him to be a moſt true prophet. There were therfore two cauſes of this trouble &amp; mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertneſſe of Ionas: The one, for that he ſuppoſed that that way only the glory of the God of Iſrael might be eſtabliſhed among the Heathen, the which otherwiſe was like to be contemned or deſpiſed, namely if thoſe things the which hee as a prophet and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:9718:76"/>preacher had in the name of God told unto them for to come to paſſe might in every reſpect ſo fall out as he had foretolde them that they ſhould. And that otherwiſe God himſelfe ſhould be accuſed of inconſtancie, and his prophets of vanitie and open lying. <note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> Jonas under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not the end of Gods threatnings.</note> The other cauſe is, for that he neither thinketh that this is the ſcope or drift of Gods threatnings, that men ſhould convert or turne, and repent (for God will not the death of a ſinner: but that he ſhould repent and live) neither doeth he eſteeme ſo much of this effect of his miniſterie, as he doth of the falling out of the matter according unto the bare word of his preaching. VVe muſt I confeſſe, be fervent or earneſt unto God (as Paul Rom. 12. v. 11. biddeth us be fervent in ſpirit) in which two cauſes, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas was greatly deceived, and moſt men for the moſt part now a dayes doe offend (whileſt they intermeddle and mingle the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The ſecond is, the defence and prooving of his cauſe and righteouſneſſe, to wit, that he did at the firſt iuſtly &amp; upon good ground take this counſell to flee away: becauſe that he did foreſee that this whole comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God unto the Ninivites would be vaine and of none effect, and hurtfull alſo unto the glory of God among them. For they would laugh God to ſcorne hereby as changeable, becauſe he brought not to paſſe the things which he threatned, or as not able to do it in the iudgement of Ionas: &amp; ſo conſequently, that they would more and more contemne or deſpiſe the true God of Iſrael. This forſooth is the fooliſhneſſe of worldly, that is to ſay, madde wiſdome. As if God knew not what courſe to take for the maintenance of the glory of his name and maieſtie of his power and godhead even among the very heathen themſelves, &amp; infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, after a farre other ſort then we can imagine.

After thoſe 40. daies then, and not before, Ionas praied ſo anger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and when as God had anſwered him, he alledgeth a reaſon of this his anſwer, and mercie towards the Niniuites, the which hee confirmeth by the confeſſion of Ionas himſelfe, and by the iſſue and likelihoode of a thing moſt apparant, to the end the counſel and purpoſe of God in pardoning them, may appeare vnto all men to be moſt wiſe and iuſt. This therefore fell out after thoſe 40. daies, ſo that Ionas did yet once againe ſhewe the malapert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and impatience of his minde, and the ſame vtterly vnexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and yet notwithſtanding it did ſpring from the ſame fountain from the which the former did.

The ſecond thing is, God out of this ſecond anger of Ionas, altogether immoderate or vnmeaſurable and raſh, taketh
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:9718:78"/>an occaſion and cauſe to condemne the former anger alſo.

This ſixt verſe containeth two things, &amp; both of them a preparation onely vnto the declaring of the anger of Ionas. Firſt, what God prepared for Ionas, yet remaining in his booth, the which he had ſlightly made of boughes: &amp; ſecondly, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>1.</hi> What God prepared for Ionas.</note> what ioy Ionas conceiued for the ſame. God ordeined &amp; would haue a gourd to grow vp for him (for ſo the word <hi>kikaion</hi> is to be tranſlated, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> What was his ioy for the ſame. Kikaion, There is great ſturre about the tranſlation of this word, but I haue rather followed thoſe which doe eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it, a gourd.</note> whatſoeuer Auguſt. epiſt. 10. ſay againſt Ierome to the contrary) and that forthwith, &amp; almoſt in one moment, for it grew vp in an artificial day, that is, within XII. equinoctial houres, v. 10. ſo high &amp; ſo ful of leaues, that it ſhadowed Ionas his whol booth, &amp; did defend him from the heat of the ſunne, the which was then moſt parching &amp; burning: and finally with the leaues thereof it made him a coole ſhadow. Therefore the growing and maner of this gourd was extraordinarie: and for this cauſe God is ſaide to haue prepared it, that is to ſay, this tree ſprang vp not by any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meane, but ſupernaturally, or extraordinarily, God ſo ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for the keeping of Ionas from griefe, that is, from that ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching heat, the which Ionas tooke moſt grieuouſly at that time, &amp; in that place. Wherin not onely the fact of God, but alſo the ende of the ſame is briefly touched, to wit, that we ſhould know that he is carefull for the leaſt diſcommoditie and griefe of thoſe that are his, that he may helpe them. And thus much did God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Ionas his ioy.</note>But Ionas for his part on the otherſide, is exceeding glad and ioyfull both for his coolth and that ſame ſuddaine ſhade giuen him by God againſt the burning of the ſunne: and alſo eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the tree or ſhrubbe it ſelfe that was ſprung vp, for the height thereof, for the leaues, for the faireneſſe, for the ſhade of it, becauſe that all theſe thinges in this gourde were ſingular

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this verſe conteineth two things: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the one, a third cauſe ſo
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:9718:79"/>the which Ionas is angrie, and praieth vnto God in that his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and heat of minde. The ſecond comprehendeth a deſcription of this anger, and prayer.</p>
                     <p>The third cauſe of Ionas his being angrie, was the parching &amp; burning of the ſunne, being greater then it was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by the means whereof it did beate vpon the head of Ionas very grieuouſly. Of this heat there were two cauſes, <note place="margin">Two cauſes of the heat men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this verſe.</note> both the ordinarie ſeaſon of the yeare, and the ſunne, &amp; alſo that ſame extraordinarie Eaſt winde, faint, and diſſoluing or looſing the members, ſuch like kinde of windes as are wont commonly to blow in the ſummer, the ayre beeing drie and void of cloudes, the which windes doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh vs, or coole the ayre: but rather increaſe the heate of the ſunne, becauſe that they alſo are hot and parching, and faint and calme. By which like meanes the Lord alſo can ſcorch and parch the fruits of the earth for the ſinnes of his people, as he teſtifieth Agg. 2.18. where he ſaith: <hi>I ſmote you with blaſting, and mildew, and with hayle, in all the labours of your hands, and yet ye turned not vnto me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Of this I gather that theſe things were done in the ſummer. For Aſſyria (in the which Ninive is) is no Southerne cuntry, that it ſhould haue any great heats, beſides in the ſummer. Here then alſo, like as before v. 2. &amp; 3. the anger of Ionas was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapert &amp; ſaucie, and the aſſault of his mind very raging, the which groweth in this place in like ſort, of the too wel liking of his owne counſell, and of the things which he approueth or alloweth. For what raſhnes and great haſtines is this, that he wiſheth and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth out of hand to die? for that he ſhould deſire this by and by, and that of God, his haſtie anger egged him on thereunto. And Ionas is here angrie through the feeling of the fleſh, as before, and that more manifeſtly, albeit that in ſhewe he ſeemed to haue a colourable &amp; reaſonable cauſe, to wit, for that he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the fairenes of the gourd that was ſprung vp, and did ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace him ſelfe therewith, as with a moſt daintie worke of God, and a fauour of the ſame God towards him, beeing oppreſſed or grieued with the heate. This is in deede a faire pretenſe or ſhewe of the fleſh. But the true originall or beginning of this kinde of anger is the waywardnes and pride of man his wit. <note place="margin">Ionas hath a faire ſhew for his anger.</note> For we doe preferre our counſails and will before the wiſedome and will of God, ſo that we take it very hardly and grieuouſly that it ſhould be and come to paſſe, the which albeit that it be done by the will of God, yet notwithſtanding it falleth out often otherwiſe then
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:9718:80"/>we would wiſh. As for Ionas he is not properly or eſpecially an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, becauſe he nowe felt the ſharpe heate of the ſunne: neither yet doth he pray, that God would ſtrengthen him to beare ſo great parching of the ſame, or that God would a bate the heat: but he is angrie, <note place="margin">The proper cauſe of Ionas his anger.</note> for that thoſe things the which he had made recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with himſelfe ſhould haue continued, and the which for the time ought to haue bin fit and commodious for him, and to be a witnes of the fauour of God towards his ſelfe and his miniſterie, the ſame were now chaunged and taken away, to wit, his braue gourd, a worke in deede of God and extraordinarily ſprung vp in the fauour of Ionas was decaied, and extraordinarily alſo periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Therefore through the ſelfe ſame carnall or fleſhly wiſdome he doth imagine the commendation of his miniſterie to lie in the gourd, like as he did before ſuppoſe his contempt, to lie in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the citie. Therefore Ionas is angrie for the dying of the gourd: and not properly for that he was ſcorched after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with the burning of the ſunne, as appeareth hereafter ver. 9. &amp; 10. and he doth not now any more deſire any other ſigne and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of God his fauour towards him, but death through a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and diſquiet affection.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He end and drift of this propheſie, is all one with the reſt of the other Prophets and their propheſies, namely, to leade vs by the feeling of our owne deſtruction and miſerie, vnto God the fountaine and father of mercie through his Chriſt: and ſo conſequently to teach vs to repent from our wicked liuing, and to ſerue the true God, and to worſhip him according vnto his law and commandement. Therefore he both layeth downe the threatnings of God, and alſo the promiſes. And firſt of all he doth in generall ſet foorth the threatnings againſt all ſinners, yea, euen men that are infidels. Then afterwards particularly againſt thoſe which call themſelues the people of God, and do boaſt themſelues of that name, ſuch as in times paſt were both the Iſraelites, and alſo the Iewes properly ſo called, and now the Chriſtians, whether Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, or Goſpellers: whereof it commeth to paſſe, that Amos be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth with thoſe iudgements of God, the which God did threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten generally againſt Idolaters. And afterwards he commeth vnto thoſe which were peculiarly addreſſed vnto the Iſraelites, vnto whom by name he was from God appoynted a Prophet. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, hee rehearſeth thoſe alſo which were ordayned againſt the Iewes themſelues, that is, againſt the kingdome of Iudah, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they alſo did vaunt themſelues vpon the praiſe and title of the people and inheritance of God, and that vpon better reaſon, then the kingdome of Iſrael. And thus much concerning the threatnings.</p>
                  <p>As for the promiſes, Amos hath the ſame which other Prophets
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:9718:82"/>haue, to wit, firſt generall vnto all mankinde, then particular vnto the true Church of God, for and through the Meſſias promiſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fathers, that is, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the which this our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet for the comfort of the godly, doth excellently ſet downe. But concerning the time wherein Amos propheſied, <note place="margin">The time wherein Amos propheſied.</note> thus I thinke, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the iudgement of others, the which I would not by this mine opinion haue to be foreſtalled. Amos ſeemeth vnto me to haue been the ſecond of all thoſe Prophets, whoſe propheſies wee haue in the volume as well of the great, as alſo the ſmall Prophets, the which are extant or to be found in the Canonical bookes of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures. And I thinke that he liued almoſt after fortie yeares at the leaſt from the death of the Prophet Elizeus, &amp; was by God rayſed vp in the kingdome of Iſrael, for that the ſame part of the people eſpecially wanted earneſt admonitions, when as it had caſt away the Word of God, and the true Sacrifices, and in the roome thereof ſet vp their owne. <note place="margin">The reaſon why the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Amos is thought to haue prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied about this time.</note> The reaſon of mine opinion is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Elizeus dyed at leaſt about the firſt beginning of the reigne of Ioas the ſonne of Ioachaz king of Iſrael: for 2. King. cap. 13. ver. 14. mention is made that Ioas came to viſite Elizeus lying in his death-bed in theſe words, <hi>When Eliſha fell ſicke of his ſicknes whereof he dyed, Ioaſh the King of Iſrael came downe vnto him, and wept on his face, and ſayd, O my father, O my father, &amp;c.</hi> And that this was in the beginning of his reigne, the diligent conſidering of that which followeth in that chapter, and in the beginning of the next, will eaſilie declare. And from that time vntill the 27. yeare of King Ieroboam (who was the ſonne of this Ioas, and in the firſt yeare in the which Vzzias began to reigne in Iudah, which was the time of the beginning of this propheſie) there doe come 41. yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene. So Amos then liued and propheſied in that age, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe teacheth. <note place="margin">Ionai ſeemeth to haue been before Amos.</note> But the Prophet Ionas ſeemeth in time to haue bin before him, which Ionas his booke of propheſie is in the Canon, or among the Canonicall bookes of the Bible, for as much as either in the reigne of Ioas the father of this Ieroboam (about the 27. yeare of whoſe reigne Amos might haue begun to propheſie) or at leaſt wiſe about the beginning of the reigne of this Ieroboam, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas executed his office, as appeareth 2. King. cap. 14. ver. 23. and ſo to the end of the chapter, and as I haue ſhewed before in my notes before theſe Prophets. So that the beginning of the Prophet Ionas may ſeem to haue bin ſome certain yeres after the death of Elizeus, the ſucceſſion of the Prophets for a time being diſcontinued, as
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:9718:82"/>eaſily may be gathered, if 2. King. cap. 13. ver. 14 be compared with cap. 14. ver. 25. Wherefore among the Prophets, <note place="margin">Ionas the firſt in time of all the Prophets canonicall.</note> whoſe writings are in the Canonicall Scripture, Ionas is the firſt in reſpect of time. For that which is obiected of Micheas, whoſe booke of propheſies is extant, is againſt this nothing at all: becauſe that Micheas is not the ſame Micheas, the which propheſied in the dayes of King A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab, and was before Ionas. And this our Amos is ſecond, <note place="margin">Amos the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Oſeas the third.</note> Oſeas third, who fell into the times of Ieroboam the ſonne of Ioas king of Iſrael, and Vzzias the ſonne of Amaſias king of Iudah: but becauſe he is ſayd to haue propheſied vnto the times of King Ezechias, it is likely that he began not at the ſelfe ſame beginning and inſtant of time, in the which thoſe two Kings (each in his kingdome) began to reigne: but a little after. For by the ſpace of 14. yeares they reigned together, Ieroboam in Iſrael, and Vzzias in Iudah. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we do graunt that Oſeas began to propheſie an yeare or two after that ſame earthquake, two yeare before the which Amos pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied: Oſeas muſt then begin to execute his office in the 31. or 32. yeare of Ieroboam the ſonne of Ioas king of Iſrael, and in the 4. or 5. yeare of Vzzias king of Iudah. For I hold that the ſame earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake happened in the ſecond yeare of the reigne of Vzzias, and in the thirtith yeare of the reigne of this Ieroboam. And Oſeas pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied vnto the beginning of Ezechias king of Iudah, beginning at the 32. yeare of the reigne of Ieroboam ſonne of Ioas, (which fell into the fifth yeare of Vzzias the king of Iudah) that is, by the ſpace of full 70 yeares, well neere. <note place="margin">Oſeas prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied almoſt full <hi>70</hi> yeares, and Amos but <hi>14.</hi>
                     </note> But Amos ſeemeth to haue fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his office within the ſpace of that time, wherein this Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam of Iſrael, and Vzzias of Iudah liued in one age together in their Kingdomes and Empires, to wit, by the ſpace onely of 14. yeares. For Amos maketh mention of no other King, either of Iſrael, or of Iudah, but of Ieroboam the ſonne of Ioas, and of Vzzias. And thus much of Ionas, Amos, and Oſeas.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Eſaias the <hi>4.</hi> Prophet in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and time.</note>The fourth in order and time ſeemeth to haue been Iſaias, and to haue begun his office after Oſeas, but to haue continued it longer, namely, vntill the times of King Manaſſes, by whom about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his reigne Iſaias was put to death. For when as Iſaias maketh no mention of this Ieroboam, who was the ſonne of Ioas, but of Vzzias, Ioatham, &amp;c. only, he ſeemeth indeed to haue begun to propheſie vnder Vzzias king of Iudah, but that ſame Ieroboam being now dead, vnder whom both Amos and Oſeas had now exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted their office of Prophets. Therefore in as much as Ieroboam
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:9718:83"/>the ſonne of Ioas king of Iſrael dyed in the 14. yeare of Vzzias the king, Iſaias cannot ſeeme to haue propheſied before this time, but afterwards about the 16. yeare of the reigne of Vzzias. From which time vnto Manaſſes, and the beginning of his reigne, there come betweene aboue 80. yeares, all which time Iſaias muſt haue executed the office of a Prophet: for he himſelfe cap. 7. maketh mention of three ſcore yeares.</p>

There followeth therfore an earneſt exhortation and a weightie, (and conceiued alſo in the name of God himſelfe) that they might auoyd theſe iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, &amp; ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (whileſt there is yet ſome time left) goe againſt the fearefull wrath of God, as it were to entreate him before hand, and that by earneſt repentance of minde.

Therefore here is ſhewed by a deſcription of the maieſtie of God himſelfe, how he is both to be giuen eare vnto, and alſo to be feared. So Paul 1.

Now this the moſt ſacred maieſtie of God is in this place layd forth vnto vs by diuers effects indeed of his power, but not by all: yet eſpecially by his name it ſelfe, whereby the true God is called the <hi>God of hosts.</hi> And ſo is he in like maner deſcribed Pſal. 68. ver. 4. by his name, in theſe words: <hi>Sing vnto God, and ſing prayſes vnto his name: exalt him that rideth vpon the heauens, in his name (Iah) and reioyce before him.</hi> For names are not without cauſe giuen vnto God, nor in vaine.

Firſt, by this reprehenſion <hi>(wo.)</hi> For this reprehenſion teacheth that they are farre and wide deceiued, which ſayd theſe things. For circumciſion which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or he which is a Iew outwardly, is not the ſeede of Abraham, or true circumciſion, or a Iew indeed, or the ſonne of Abraham. So Paul. 2. Col. 4. ver. 11. teacheth, that the inward circumciſion is the true circumciſion, ſpeaking of the faithfull among them, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Inwhom</hi> (meaning in Chriſt) <hi>alſo ye are circumciſed with cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion made without hands, by putting off the ſinful bodie of the fleſh, through the circumciſion of Chriſt.</hi> And to the Rom. cap. 2. ver. 28. he ſayth: <hi>He is not a Iew, which is one outward, neither is that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which is outward in the fleſh.</hi> And Rom. 9. ver. 7. <hi>They are not</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>all children, becauſe they are the ſeede of Abraham.</hi> Therefore by this anſwer they ſhal ſeeke vnto themſelues deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not helpe or ayd at all. For this wo is threatned vnto them in the name of God, that is, there is threatned vnto them a curſe, &amp; anger, and puniſhment. Secondly, the Prophet refuteth them by the deſcription of the Day of the Lord, that is of Iudgement (the which theſe boaſted that they would haue, &amp; wiſhed for to come) the which ſheweth moſt heauie deſtruction to fall vpon them. For this day, although it be the comming and day of the Lord, yet ſhall it be vnto them not a day of light, but of darknes. So the Prophet Zephaniah cap. 1. ver. 15. ſayth: <hi>That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and heauines, a day of deſtruction and deſolation, a day of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuritie and darknes, a day of cloudes and blacknes.</hi> And the Prophet Iſai. cap. 5. ver. 19. pronounceth a woe againſt them that, after this mocking manner of the Iſraelites in this place, wiſh for the proofe and experience of the Lord his worke and counſel, ſaying: <hi>Let him make ſpeede: let him hasten his worke that we may ſee it: and let the counſell of the holie one of Iſrael draw neere, and come, that we may know it.</hi> The day of the Lord is indeed light in it ſelfe: but vnto thoſe hypocrites it ſhall not be light.</p>

And they ſuppoſed the power of the kingdome, and their king alſo (by whome they iudged that they ſhould be well inough defended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all enemies) to be vnconquerable. Whereupon there was in them not only a certaine confidence or truſt in the mountaine and citie of Samaria: but alſo ſuch a truſt, that they did wholly reſt and ſtay therein, as in a defence that could not be wonne. And therefore they ſlept ſoundly, and without all feare againſt enemies and the threatnings of God. For ſuch a kinde of ſecuritie or careleſnes doth the Hebrew word <hi>(Schaan)</hi> betoken. And that the citie Samaria was the head citie of that kingdome, and ſeated or built vpon a Mountaine, appeareth 1.

For when as that is done of vs, all their whole fruite and vſe is turned into pompe, vaine boaſting, arrogancie, pride, and nicenes or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catnes of minde. Therefore then are our riches a token, and a foſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our vices, and not an helping of the poore, or a beſtowing of them vpon certaine holy workes, for which vſe God beſtoweth ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and goods, that is, his benefites vpon vs. For the beſtowing of theſe gifts after the manner of the world vpon the ſatisfying of the luſts of the fleſh, is not any token of the children of God: <hi>For</hi> (as Iohn ſayth 1.

For in the Pſalm. 89. ver. 33.34. God ſpeaketh of them after this maner: <hi>Yet my louing kindnes will I not take from him, neither will I falſifie my trueth. My couenant will I not breake, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lippes, &amp;c.</hi> as it there followeth more at large.<note place="margin">

For this doth not agree with the good will and louing kindnes of God to ward men, yea and that which more is, with his eſpeciall couenant towards his people, to afflict or puniſh him being afflicted or puniſhed already; and being fallen, to thruſt him further into the extreameſt miſerie of deſtruction. Laſtly, that he ſhuld ſhew forth the great &amp; fearful power of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe that are his,<note place="margin">It ſtandeth not with God his mercy to vſe ex tremity vnto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe that are his: for that he keepeth for his enemies.</note> &amp; men that are almoſt conſumed alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and that he ſhould quite and clean ſwallow them vp, being as it were at the laſt caſt, and brought ſo low that they can ſcarſe fetch their breath. And therefore Dauid in his Pſalmes doth often pray that he wil not vſe againſt his, but reſerue for his enemies, his great wrath, ſtrength and power to be powred and ſhewed forth vpon them: as Pſalm. 89. verſ. 6. <hi>Powre out thy wrath vpon the heathen that haue not knowne thee, and vpon the kingdomes that haue not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon thy name.</hi> But for the faithful he prayeth: <hi>Returne (ô Lord, how long?) and be pacified toward thy ſeruants.</hi> And Pſal. 130. verſ. 3, 4. <hi>If thou, ô Lord, ſtraightly markest iniquities, ô Lord who ſhall ſtand?

                        <note place="margin">The last Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Amos.</note>THe laſt propheſie and Sermon of Amos, the which confirmeth vnto the Iſraelites the ſame, which God had threatned vnto them before, namely, that the vtter deſtruction of this kingdome is at hand. Therefore doth this threatning alſo properly belong vnto the kingdome of Iſrael. And God by ſo many waies, and at ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeuerall times auoucheth and foretelleth vnto them one and the ſame thing, to take away all excuſe from the Rebels and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. But concerning this Sermon and propheſie, the ſame alſo is repreſented and ſhewed by a viſion, that it may the rather moue the mindes of the readers and hearers, and that by the offering and laying before them of a ſtrange and vnwonted forme and manner of the matter, he might bring them in feare, and make them atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue or readie to heare. And the peculiar and eſpeciall ende of this propheſie and ſermon is to ſhew, That God will take from the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, all their ſafeſt and ſureſt aydes and ſtarting holes as they thought, the which they placed eſpeciallie, and chiefely in their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and idol places, that is in the temples of their idols. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſheweth in this place, like as before, that hee will ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe them, and that they the Iſraelites ſhall come into great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie and vtter deſtruction becauſe of their wickednes.</p>

                           <hi>1.</hi> A viſion.</note> God ſtoode vpon a certaine altar, and commanded the vaulte or archroofe of the temple, in which that altar was, to be ſmitten, yea and moreouer, the poſtes (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon both that arch-roofe and temple reſted) to be pulled downe, and euery poſte from the toppe to the foote, to be cut and diuided by the middle, ſo that euery poſte might fall downe. Theſe things were repreſented or ſhewed vnto this Prophet neither in Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, nor yet in the Temple of Salomon, but at Beth-el, where then Amos conuerſed or aboad, as before cap. 7. Yea and in the altar
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:9718:140"/>and Temple of Beth-el, not that God by that his preſence did coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance or allowe thoſe places (the which were mere idolatrie) but that he comming into the thing preſent, and drawing his Prophet alſo thereinto, and vnto the conſideration thereof, hee might the rather, and more aſſuredly ſhew vnto theſe ſuperſtitious perſons, being ſuch alſo as put great truſt and confidence in their idoll of Beth-el, that God would at once take all theſe things from them, and therefore that they did in vaine flee vnto this both temple and altar. So 1. King. 13. God biddeth the Prophet to goe euen vnto the idolatrous altar of Beth-el, that he might with his finger poynt out the deſtruction of the ſame, not to ſhew that he made any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or reckoning of that altar, albeit that for the altars ſake hee ſent his Prophet euen vnto Beth-el. Neither is it a thing any more abſurd or contrarie to reaſon, that God ſhould be ſeene on this ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous altar, then afterwards in the temple of Salomon, when as it was profaned or defiled exceedingly, of which apparition of God in the Temple of God then greatly polluted ſee Ezech. cap. 1. for in that he appeareth vpon this impure altar, this is onely done to ſhew the more aſſured deſtruction thereof: not that thereby any dignitie or reuerence might be woune vnto this Altar.

So then thoſe which before were not the people of God, the ſame afterwardes were made his, not onely people and inheritance, but alſo his ſonnes, and the Temple of the liuing GOD, ſuch as were both the Gentiles and alſo the Iſraelites being conuerted vnto the Goſpel, and gathered together by Chriſt into one ſheepfold, as Chriſt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth Iohn 10. ver. 16. where ſpeaking of the Gentiles in time to be gathered vnto the Church of the Iewes he ſayth: <hi>Other ſheepe I haue alſo, which are not of this folde: them alſo must I bring, and they ſhall heare my voyce: and there ſhal be one ſheepfold and one ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard.</hi> And vnto theſe doth Peter Epiſt. 1. cap. 2. ver. 9. giue very glorious titles, when he calleth them, <hi>A choſen generation, a royall Priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar (or purchaſed) people, to ſhewe foorth the vertues of him that hath called them out of darkenes into his marueylous light.</hi>

But occaſion and graunting, and meanes of all ioy ſhall bee taken from them. And ſurely it is meete and reaſon, in as much as ſuch puniſhment (as is here threatned againſt wicked perſons, Idolators, and back ſliders) is a certaine earneſt &amp; ſenſie of euerlaſting death appointed for them, that they ſhould alſo bee depriued and voide of all comfort, and ioy, and of all mirth and gladnes. And in this place the Prophet hath comprized all kinde of publike and priuate comfort.

The which is afterwards particularly declared, but in this place there is firſt generally ſet downe after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner God will before hand prepare the ſame remnant, before that he wil gather out of them the ſame church vnto himſelf. Firſt of al ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he will ſo inwardly moue them by his holy ſpirite, that they ſhall long after God, and ſeeke his word: <hi>I will allure them,</hi> ſayth hee. After the ſame ſorte God ſpeaketh before, Amos 8. ver. 12. of their longing and ſeeking after the word of God. So Dauid Pſal. 42. ver. 2. expreſſeth his longing after GOD, ſaying: <hi>My ſoule thirsteth for God, euen for the liuing God: When ſhall I come and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before the preſence of God?</hi> And agayne Pſalm. 84. ver. 2. <hi>My ſoule longeth, yea, and faynteth for the courts of the Lorde: for mine heart and my fleſh reioyce in the liuing God.</hi> Secondly, he ſhal ſpeak vnto that remnant with a ſounding voice in the outward miniſtery by his Prophets and Apoſtles, and their lawful ſucceſſours. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God ſpeaketh thoſe things which ſhall be vnto them moſt hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, wiſhed for, ioyfull, and pleaſant and well liking to theyr hearts, to wit, he ſhall ſpeake of their ſaluation, of their peace with God, of the forgiuenes of their ſinnes. All which thinges are moſt ioyfull newes, and indeede the Goſpel of Chriſt. So Pſal. 85. ver. 2, and 10. Dauid ſaith: <hi>Thou hast forgiuen the iniquitie of thy people, and couered all their ſinnes. Mercie and trueth ſhall meete: righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and peace ſhall kiſſe one another.</hi> And ſo is the Pſal. 126. full of moſt ſweet ioyes that the godly after their returne from the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie ſhal be filled withall. The fourth thing here to be noted,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>4.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this great mercy ſhall bee ſhewed vnto them.</note> is the time, after the which this ſo great mercie of God ſhall happen
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:9718:162"/>vnto them, namely, after that God hath afflicted or puniſhed this nation of Iſraell, and that after ſuch a ſort, that, as at the firſt they wandred in the moſt waſte deſart of Sinai: (when as they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered out of Egypt) ſo when as they ſhall be brought againe euen vnto the ſame condition and eſtate, and ſhall be driuen againe into an horrible deſart, becauſe of their long captiuitie in the mountains of Media: for thither were they diſperſed as appeareth 2. King. 17. Theſe things then were not to come to paſſe forth with and by and by: but then at laſt after the long exile and captiuity of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among ſtrange, and ſauage nations and countries. And theſe things ſhall then eſpecially come to paſſe, when as God ſhall haue pittie on Iſrael, and that whole people ſhall be ſaued, and by fayth ſhall receiue Chriſt, as Paul teacheth that it ſhall come to paſſe Rom. 11. ver. 26. where he writeth: <hi>And ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaued, as it is written, The deliuerer ſhall come out of Sion; and ſhall turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the vngodlines from Iaacob.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding theſe things did in parte fall out as often as God in any age before that ſame ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall calling, did by the preaching of the Goſpel conuert or turne any of them vnto him: or elſe by the preaching of his Prophets brought them vnto his true worſhip, as vnder King Ezechias.</p>

For there foode and ſuſtenance was promiſed: but here peace and great tranquillity or quietnes. And this kinde of benefites alſo is an eſpecial gift of God, the which is oppoſed or ſet agaynſt the former calamities and miſeries of this people, the which by warres they had now already ſo often felt. Of this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:9718:163"/>of GOD towardes the godly the lawe maketh mention Deut. 28. Alſo Pſal. 25. ver. 13. where the Pſalmiſt ſpeaking of the godly man, ſayth: <hi>His ſoule ſhall dwell at eaſe, and his ſeede ſhall inherite the land.</hi> And Pſal. 144. ver. 14. among other the bleſſings in that Pſalme reckoned vp, he addeth: <hi>That there be none inuaſion, nor go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, nor no crying in our ſtreetes.</hi> Further, there is in this place promiſed vnto the Church peace both with the bruite beaſtes and alſo with men themſelues. And with the bruit beaſts, becauſe that by the beaſts men are wont to bee troubled; and beaſtes, together with the hurt that they may doe vnto men, is reckoned vp among the foure ſortes of God his plagues Ezec. 14. ver. 21. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord God:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">God his foure ſore iudgments</note> 
                        <hi>How much more when I ſend my foure ſore iudgments vpon Ieruſalem, euen the ſworde, and famine, and the noyſome beast, and pestilence, to deſtroy man and beast out of it?</hi> And Eliphas Iob 5. ver. 23. doth in like maner rehearſe this ſecurity from the feare of the beaſts of the fielde, as a ſpeciall fauour of God towards the godly when hee ſayth: <hi>For the ſtones of the field ſhall be in league with thee, and the beasts of the field ſhall bee at peace with thee.</hi> But when God ſhall performe this bleſſing here promiſed, the godly ſhall haue peace and ſecuritie, or freedome from danger euen from all kinde of beaſts, whether they haue their being in heauen (that is in the ayre) or in the waters, or in the earth. For they are all at God his command to execute his iudgement, vpon the diſobedient vnto his word. And hereof we haue example in the Lyons ſent in by God vpon thoſe Idolatrous nations, whom the king of Aſſyria placed in the Land of Iſrael, who <hi>ſlew them</hi> (as they themſelues complaine) <hi>becauſe they knew not the manner of the God of the land,</hi> 2.

And this is acknowledged for God his great benefite Act. 9. ver. 31. where it is mentioned, <hi>That the Churches then had rest through all Iudea, and Galile, and Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, and were edified, and walked in the feare of the Lord, and were multiplyed by the comfort of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> So Pſal. 46. ver. 9.

For ſo doth Paul euidently expound this place.<note place="margin">The comfort.</note> The comfort which here is promiſed, briefly is, the conuerſion of this people ſo caſt off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſo paſt all hope of recouerie, vnto God notwithſtanding, and their vniting and knitting into the Church. They ſhall then be conuerted, to wit, vnto God, and that by faith of the Goſpell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, whom theſe ſhall embrace, albeit the Iewes cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him. And further here is declared manifeſtly, who ſhalbe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, and after what manner. And the children of Iſrael ſhall bee conuerted, that is, thoſe ſelfe ſame, which being ſeuered from the kingdome of Iudah, were called Iſrael. For Paul ſaith, All Iſrael, and not the Iewes alone ſhall embrace Chriſt through the preaching of the Goſpell. And they ſhall ſo repent, that firſt they ſhall ſeeke the true God for their God; and not ſtraunge gods any more, vnto whom they looked before: but <hi>(Iehouah)</hi> that is, the ſame God that is almightie. Secondly, the ſame Iſraelites ſhall ſeeke Dauid their king, that is, the true Chriſt, of whom Dauid was a figure, and the author of the ſeede. For Chriſt, as he is man, is of the ſeede of Dauid. In this place therefore Dauid is taken for that ſame true Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, that is Chriſt, who was the trueth of that Dauid which was the king, and who hath an euerlaſting kingdom in the Church of God, the which is the houſe of Dauid. And therefore Luk. 2. ver. 32.33. the Angell telleth the Virgin Mary, <hi>That the Lord God ſhall giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the throne of Dauid his father, and that he ſhall reigne ouer the houſe of Iacob for euer, and of his kingdome ſhall be none end.</hi> But theſe ſelfe ſame Iſraelites had wickedly pulled and rent themſelues from the kingdome of Dauid, that is, from the Church 1. King. 12. yet at that time they ſhall ioyne themſelues vnto the Church, and that
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:9718:169"/>moſt earneſtly. Laſtly, they ſhall with feare and admiration or wondering at ſo great a benefit of God towards them turne vnto God. For this feare or trembling in this place is nothing elſe but an admiration, &amp; that very exceeding, at the ſo great mercy &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God towards them. So Ierem. 33. ver. 9. God ſheweth that he will in ſuch ſorte deale for Ieruſalem, and the captiue Iſraelites, that all that ſhall <hi>heare of it ſhall feare and tremble for all the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and for all the wealth that he will ſhew vnto that citie.</hi> It is not then ſuch a feare and a trembling as ſhall driue away, and fray men from God: but ſuch as ſhall allure and draw men vnto God.</p>

For our ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commeth not of the ſtore of meate that we eate, but of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God vpon the ſame.

He crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth and boweth: therefore heapes of the poore doe fall by his might.</hi> In this therefore did theſe princes and rulers imitate, or do after the maners and diſpoſition of moſt wicked and craftie theeues raung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rouing vp and downe in the woods, who to the end they
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:9718:183"/>may the more ſafely murther and cut the throates of trauailers and wayfaring men, they ſtay for them in moſt hidden and ſecret dales and valleyes, and prepare ſuch ambuſhments to intrap and catch them as they are leaſt aware of.<note place="margin">What the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra is ſee Amos cap. <hi>4.</hi> ver. <hi>12.</hi>
                        </note> And further by this Metaphor of profound or deepe places and corners are ſignified the diuelliſh &amp; moſt craftie counſels of tyrannous Magiſtrates againſt the people, (whom they are wont at their pleaſure both to ſpoyle and to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) the which notwithſtanding by them are couered with moſt glorious pretences and edicts, ſo that nothing is more filthie and ſhamefull then theſe diuelliſh ſhifts, and nothing more deepe then theſe ſecret and deepe deceipts and ſubtilties. So Apocal. 2. ver. 24. God ſayth to them of Thyatira that haue not knowne the deepnes of Satan, (meaning his ſecret and hidden craftines and ſubtiltie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnder the glorious titles of high &amp; moſt ſingular knowledge and learning) he will put vpon them none other burthen. But here in this verſe God by way of contraries doth expound and declare himſelfe, what maner a one he will be vnto theſe tyrannous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, to wit, he will oppoſe or ſet himſelfe againſt all their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties, be they neuer ſo ſubtill. So then when he ſayth <hi>(I haue been a rebuker, or there ſhall be a chaſtiſing or rebuking vnto theſe)</hi> he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that he will chaſtiſe, correct and puniſh them: yea and that all of them, ſo that neither their dignitie, nor their ſubtiltie ſhall be able to couer any of them, or to deliuer them from the hand of God. Wherefore, although they be the rulers of the people, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding haue they a Iudge, that is aboue them, or higher then they.</p>

This contrarietie then, as I haue ſayd, ſtandeth vpon two poynts, of the which the firſt ſetteth the cleare ſightednes of the eyes of God, and his moſt high knowledge, the which he hath of euery particular man, and their counſels againſt the deceits of theſe Princes and Rulers. For God is he that knoweth the heart and all things are manifeſt or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in his ſight. As the writer to the Hebrewes cap. 4. ver. 13. wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, ſaying: <hi>Neither is there any creature, which is not manifest in his ſight: but all things are naked and open vnto his eyes, with whom we haue to doe.</hi> Wherefore God ſaith, <hi>I know Ephraim: this Iſrael is not vnknowne vnto me,</hi> that is to ſay, theſe kings and princes of the kingdome of Iſrael: but they are well and throughly knowne and ſeene into of me, what they hide in their heart, what they doe, what they thinke and diſſemble, I knowe it all. Therefore by the name of Ephraim I thinke the kings to be noted: and by the name of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, the Counſellers. For out of the tribe of Ephraim came the firſt kinges of this kingdome. The houſe of Iſrael were called the Counſellers before. God therefore knoweth them all, both as a witneſſe, and alſo as one that will bee a iudge, and a puniſher of their wickedneſſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part of this contrariety pronounceth plainly of the deedes of theſe Princes, to wit, that they all are ſo wicked and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy as is fornication or whoredome: ſo that they make them all to be vncleane and defiled howſoeuer they may ſeeme vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to haue well coloured them, and that the ſame among men be thought to be iuſt. Compare this place with the Pſal. 94. verſ. 7, 8, 9, where the vngodly thinke to keepe their Tyrannie and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from the knowledge of God, as the Prophet in that place bewrayeth their pretences, ſaying: <hi>Yet they ſay, The Lord ſhall not ſee: neither will the God of Iaacob regard it.

So then Iudah fleeth not vnto any one King onely, but vnto diuers Kings, and all of them idolaters, to wit, as diſtruſting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God towards them, and making more account of the help of idolaters, and iudging it more certaine then the helpe of the true God. They flee vnto the Aſſyrians 2. King. 16. They flee vnto the Egyptians Iſai. 31.1. They flee vnto the Iſraelites 2. Chro. 25. ver. 6. Iſai. 8. ver. 6 Reade cap. 10. ver. 6. hereafter.

But God anſwereth, that he did not chiefely and eſpecially deſire thoſe ſacrifices, and outwarde things: but rather mercie towards their neighbour, and the true knowledge of himſelfe out of his holy word written. Therefore as there are two tables of the law of God: ſo is there in this place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a double end thereof by the prophet, who beginneth at the ſecond table, the effects whereof are better knowne vnto vs. For the end thereof is Mercie, Bounteouſnes, or Charitie towards our
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:9718:196"/>neighbour: and the ſumme of the firſt table is the true knowledge and vnderſtanding of God. There is a like place vnto this 1. Sam. 15. ver. 22. Where Samuel ſaith vnto Saul, <hi>Hath the Lord as great pleaſure in burnt offerings and ſacrifices, as when the voyce of the Lord is obeyed? Behold, to obey, is better then ſacrifice, and to hearken, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the fat of Rammes.</hi> And Matth. 9. ver. 13. and 12. ver. 7. this ſelfeſame place of Oſeas is alleadged by Chriſt againſt the Scribes and Phariſes. And Mic. 6. ver. 8. againſt thoſe that truſt vnto the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their ſacrifices the Prophet ſpeaketh thus: <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good, and what the Lord requireth of thee: ſurely to doe iuſtly, and to loue mercie, and to humble thy ſelfe, to walke with thy God.</hi> And Paul Rom. 13. ver. 8. willeth them, ſaying: <hi>Owe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to any man, but to loue one another: for he that loueth another hath fulfilled the law.</hi> See Paul Rom. 13.</p>

<pb n="435" facs="tcp:9718:198"/>indeuour of theſe Iſraelites to ſpred it abroad among others, that they had infected Iudah it ſelfe alſo with this ſinne. For the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites had ſowen the moſt ſhameful ſeedes therof among the Iewes, the which afterwards grew vp, and brought forth their crop, that is their fruite, and the ſame moſt vnhappie, and lamentable, but yet moſt plentifull, and ſpeedie.<note place="margin">What a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor is, ſee A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos. cap. <hi>4.</hi> ver. <hi>12.</hi>
                        </note> Wherefore it is a Metaphoricall kinde of ſpeaking, when as the contagion and infection of the idolatrie of the Iſraelites by them at the firſt conueighed, ſcattered, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted vnto the Iewes, and afterwards growing vp among the Iewes themſelues, is called an harueſt, (or as ſome tranſlate it, a plant). Furthermore, the time is rehearſed, wherein the Iewes were in ſuch ſort corrupted and infected by the Iſraelites: namely, whileſt God brought them backe againe being captiues, that is, taken by the Iſraelites. This hiſtorie appertaineth vnto the times of Achaz king of the Iewes 2. Chro. 28. for then were the Iewes ouercome &amp; taken by the Iſraelites, yet were they liberally, and freely by them let goe againe. Through which benefite it is likely that the Iewes were moued to fauour both the Iſraelites, and alſo their religion, that is, their idolatrie: and from thence took thoſe ſeedes, the which afterward grew vp, and made them more readie and forward vnto horrible idolatrie vnder Achaz their king, as appeareth 2. Chro. 28. ver. 22. and in that which there followeth. So eaſie doubtleſſe is the nature of man to bee drawne into idolatrie, and with ſo ſmall adoe can idolaters deceiue men, as the fiſh is beguiled with the baite. And ſo quickly, as it is 1. Cor. 15. ver. 33. doth <hi>euill ſpeakings corrupt good maners.</hi> So alſo euen at this day many being rewarded with benefites from the Turke, doe firſt of all grow into a liking of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh blaſphemie: and in the end become Turkes themſelues alſo. So in like manner in our time now, many profeſſors of the Goſpell become Papiſts, being allured with their bounteouſnes and libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. For benefites doe often ſo beguile vs, that we fauour our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors and weldoers to the reproch of God himſelfe: the which notwithſtanding ought not in any caſe to be allowed, nay, it is to be condemned.</p>

                     <p>AN ouerplus or addition vnto that which went before. For in the former chapter he declared the corruption of all degrees of this kingdome of Iſrael: but here he giueth in as it were for an aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, or an ouer-draught and meaſure, the particular horrible and lewd corruption and courſe of life of the Nobles &amp; Princes (whom before he had briefly reprehended with the reſt) and doth more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently ſet downe and handle the ſame, as the fountaine and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of all that corruption, the which he had condemned before. Wherefore this now inſueth and followeth of the former argument or matter, which the Prophet hath alreadie handled, that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſtate of this people may be knowne to haue been deſperate, &amp; very miſerable: like as in the chapter before going, the priuate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of theſe men was ſhewed to haue been corrupt and wretched.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Three parts of this verſe.</note>But this verſe containeth three things. For firſt of all is ſhewed what was the occaſion of finding out of this miſchiefe, the which he hereafter rehearſeth.<note place="margin">

For they doe moſt ſhamefully and fouly corrupt and ſpill the reſt of the citizens and inhabitants with their example. For the experience of all ages teacheth that ſaying of Plato to be true, That ſuch as the Princes and Rulers are, ſuch alſo are the reſt of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.

And firſt of all it is ſet downe in generall: then particularly by the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts and ſorts of their lewdnes and wickedneſſe. And general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, when as their wickedneſſe is termed <hi>iniquitie, and falſehood:</hi> nay in the plurall number <hi>wickedneſſes, and ſubtilties or falſehoods,</hi> that theſe Princes may be proued to haue abounded in all kind of lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, together with their chiefe citie: and not with one or two hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſinnes: albeit notwithſtanding that ſome ſinnes hereafter reckoned vp, and ſome outragious offences were committed licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly among them, and with full ſway reigned and floriſhed.

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:9718:200"/>kingdome among the Princes are, at home Deceit: and abroad Violence. For at home they are theeues, as being ſuch who by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and crafte take away from the poore that which is theirs, and deuiſe ſhiftes to pull from their ſubiects their goods. But abroad and without their cities they are gathered together by heapes, after the manner of theeues and robbers, to robbe and ſpoile euery man. The life of ſome Noble men of our time as they are called, could not be better paynted out then it is in this place repreſented and ſhewed forth vnder the name and perſon of the Princes and Rulers of Iſrael.</p>

Yet theſe a e ſuch daies in the which thanks are rather to be giuen vnto God, both by the Kings themſelues, and alſo by their Princes, then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this maner, to giue ouer themſelues vnto wantonnes and ſinne: in as much as then they call to minde againe the remembrance of the benefite receiued from God, and the ſame indeede a moſt ſingular benefite. Example in the Pſalm. 2. and 18.21. and 22. where Dauid celebrateth or keepeth the remembrance of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalling in his kingdome, or of his coronation. Example alſo in Mat. 14. ver. 6. where the birth day of King Herod is holden, albeit not in ſuch manner as it ought to be. So then <hi>(the day of the king)</hi> is taken for that day, in the which the King holdeth and keepeth publikely the remembrance of ſome eſpeciall benefite of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. And this was the firſt circumſtance of time, the which increaſeth this ſinne of theſe Courtiers.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the adioints alſo do make the former lewdnes of the Princes greater,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> From the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynts.</note> to wit, For that they haue added vnto this burning luſt of the fleſh, or whoredome ſingular intemperancie, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting or gurmandiſe. For they drinke not wine out of cuppes, but out of flagons and bottels, the which they carouſe all out, and that ſo intemperately, that both themſelues, and alſo the King and other princes (the which by them are vrged vnto ſuch quaffings) waxe ſicke in the ende thereby. So then they ſinne two wayes, namely, by the abuſing of the gifts of God, to wit, meates and wine: and alſo their health (the which in like manner is the gift of God) the which by this meanes they doe loſe, hurt, and impaire. And this is a ſigne and token of notorious and moſt intemperate gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandiſe. And theſe vices alwayes for the moſt parte are linked and yoked together, namely, whoredom and ſurfetting or drunkennes. For as one ſayth, without good cheare and wine luſt is colde. But now there is added alſo a certaine third thing, that is to ſay, That the King being accuſtomed vnto ſuch a looſe, vnbridled and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked life, in the ende <hi>ſtretcheth out his hands to</hi> (or with) <hi>ſcorners,</hi> that is to ſay, is delighted with men that contemne or deſpiſe God, both learneth and alloweth or liketh their maners, and adioyneth himſelfe vnto them. And finally at the laſt he himſelfe caſteth off all feare of God, all ſhamefaſtnes and modeſtie: by whoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the reſt alſo become ſcorners of God. Now a ſcorner, is a moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of God, as Peter epiſt. 2. cap. 3. ver. 3. calleth him, that is to ſay,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:9718:202"/>an open gyber and ieſter at the Godhead, power, and maieſtie of God, ſo that he which is ſuch a manner of perſon, can now no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be kept within the bounds of his dutie, or be touched with any ſhame. Whereby is vnderſtoode, howe lamentable and miſerable the eſtate of thoſe common-wealthes is, in the which ſuch Princes beare rule as are giuen vnto drunkennes and wine, or els doe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low whoredome. For they doe not onely neglect or foreſlow the publike buſines or matters of the common-wealth, growing bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh and ſenſeleſſe through wine and women, but alſo doe quench and put out in themſelues and others all remnants of religion and ſparkles of the feare of God through their example. Worthily therefore is ſurfetting in the Proverbs forbidden both vnto Kings &amp; alſo vnto all thoſe which haue the gouernment of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Prov. 31. ver. 4, 5. where it is ſaid: <hi>It is not for Kings, O Lemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, it is not for Kings to drinke wine, nor for Princes ſtrong drinke, leaſt he drinke and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of all the children of affliction.</hi> And from hence alſo we learn howe Kinges by little and little are corrupted by Courtiers, and by certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are framed and drawne vnto great Iewdneſſe and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>The third place of this amplification, is from the Perſons.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>3.</hi> From the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> Theſe whorehunting and drunken Noble-men, doe not onely corrupt themſelues, nor the people; but others beſides, yea euen the Princes of the kingdome, nay the King himſelfe alſo, as I haue ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, vpon whome lieth the whole charge of the common-wealth. Wherefore theſe, whileſt they ſpill the King, doe ouerthrowe the whole common-wealth, as being the publike enemies of the ſame. Thus then it appeareth, how great a miſchiefe in euery kingdome the corruption of the Court is.</p>

For he amplifieth their iniquitie, as he termeth it hereafter ver. 13. and ſheweth that they haue vtterly caſt away the helpe of God, &amp; deſpiſed the ſame, that in their afflictions they might flee vnto men, and the ſame ſuch as were idolaters, and couetous, and hauing care for none but for themſelues. Therefore they had cleane forgotten the couenant of God, of the which the Prophet ſpake before cap. 5. ver. 1. and his promiſes, or els they thought them vaine, or deſpiſed them. So then in this place not only the diſtruſt of the Iſraelites, but their falling away, and their deſperate fleeing and departing from God is ſignificantly deſcribed. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>They went vp vnto the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians:</hi> therefore they did it with great labour, ſeeking forraine and farre off helpe, and the ſame idolatriſh: when as notwithſtanding they had God preſent, and their helper at hand, if they had called vpon him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and truſted vnto his couenant. Secondly, they fled vnto the Aſſyrian being as a wild aſſe, that is, a ſolitary beaſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fierce, cruell, and profitable onely for himſelfe, and gaping after gaine. In theſe words, and vnder this ſimilitude is painted out the both couetous, and alſo the cruell nature and diſpoſition of the Aſſyrians, whom the Iſraelites called vnto them, when as notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God, whom they had deſpiſed, was, and had been moſt manifeſt vnto them, and alwayes moſt mercifull. For this is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the wild aſſe, as appeareth by theſe places Iob. 38. ver. 8. <hi>Who hath ſet the wilde aſſe at libertie? or who hath looſed the bands of the wilde aſſe?</hi> And Iere. 2. ver. 24. the people for their ſtubbornnes and vnrulines are likened vnto a wilde aſſe, of whom he ſayth that they are <hi>as a wilde aſſe, vſed to the wilderneſſe, that ſnuffeth vp the winde by occaſion at her pleaſure, who can turne her back?

Further, theſe Iſraelites call vnto them the Aſſyrians whom they loue, and whom the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians loue not againe, ſo that, as it is Ezech. 16. ver. 33. this people of Iſrael committing fornication againſt God, beſides the maner of all other harlots, doth her ſelfe giue a reward vnto her louers, and receiueth none of them: the which is a moſt plentifull witneſſe of ſhameles luſt, and of a common ſhameles harlot.

                        </note>THis is the figure <hi>Hypophora,</hi> or anſwering of an obiection that might be made, wherewith God anſweareth the fooliſh ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or careleſnes of the Iſraelites, becauſe that vnder Ieroboam the ſonne of Ioas king of Iſrael, and ſome other kings that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, they inioyed peace, power, and ſtrength, and a tolerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of things. And therefore they hoped that they ſhould eſcape vnpuniſhed; and made no great reckoning of the former threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, or ſtoode in any great feare of them. And this is a thing the which hypocrites are wont to doe, by the preſent reaſonable eſtate of earthly thinges, and onely for the time, proſperous vnto them, faining God alſo to be appeaſed with them, and therefore ſleeping in their ſinnes. God therefore denieth that ioy of the Iſraelites to be true ioy, or to be ſuch, as for the which they ſhould flatter them, ſelues, or reioyce in ſuch ſort as they doe, the which enioy ſounde ioy. Neither is the ſentence once by God pronounced againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, therefore reuolted or called backe, becauſe that for a little brunt and breath of time, they ſeeme vnto themſelues happie, and to be at reſt and quiet. Therefore he ſaith: <hi>Reioyce not, O Iſrael, as other people,</hi> and as they doe, who haue true ioy of minde from God. For thou art not free from puniſhment. And ſurely when as the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cry peace, peace, then vtter deſtruction hangeth ouer their heads. 1. Theſſ. 5. ver. 3. And therefore Ierem. cap. 8. ver. 11. the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of thoſe falſe prophets which haue beguiled his people with ſweete words and promiſes of peace, hardening them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in their ſinne, where he ſaith: <hi>They haue healed the hurt of the daughter of my people, with ſweete words, ſaying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace.</hi> And this in the end doe the deceiued people finde, and confeſſe in the ſame chap. ver. 15. ſaying: <hi>We looke for peace, but no good came, and for a time of health, and behold troubles.</hi>

For they had their idols, and their altars in euery corne floore, and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery wine preſſe, in the which they did offer ſacrifice vnto thoſe their gods, that plenty and ſtore of corne, wine, and other things neceſſary for the life of man, might be giuen vnto them. The which was and is playnely the reward of an harlot, when as a rewarde is giuen vnto idols, that is, vnto ſpiritual harlots. And all theſe things indeede are both promiſed and alſo giuen by the onely and true God, and not by idols, whatſoeuer idolators do wickedly think and contend to the contrary. For ſaith Paul 1. Cor. 8. verſ. 6. <hi>There is one God, which is the father, of whom are all things.</hi> And ſo is Dauid perſwaded, that howſoeuer or whence ſoeuer others looke to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their deſires and things neceſſary for this life, he ſhall by the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing fauour and countenance of God towards him haue more ioye and comfort of heart, and peace of conſcience, then the vngodly in all their aboundance, vnto whomſoeuer they impute the ſame the which commeth onely from the goodnes and bounty of God Pſalm. 4. verſ. 6, 7. <hi>Many ſay, who will ſhew vs any good, but Lord lift vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs. Thou hast giuen me more ioy of heart, then they haue had, when their wheate and wine did abound.</hi>

And therefore when he had the choyce giuen him for a puniſhment of his ſinne, in cauſing the people to be numbred, either of ſeuen yeres famine, or three moneths fleeing before his enemies, or of three dayes peſtilence, he anſwered and

Thus then in theſe words doubtleſſe is deſcribed the nature of diſſolute or looſe and idle perſons, and ſuch as are altogether giuen vnto pleaſures. And albeit theſe by nature were ſuch, yet GOD notwithſtanding with great diligence dreſſed and tilled them. For he vſed both his lawe, the which he gaue them by Moſes: and alſo the labour and trauaile of diuers Prophets, the which he raiſed vp vnto them, that he might
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:9718:231"/>ride vpon them, and as an honorable Rider, ſit vpon them, breake them, beate downe the fiercenes of their nature, and that he might rule and reigne in their hearts. And theſe things are declared and made plaine by the ſelfe ſame Metaphor borowed from horſemen and plowers. Therefore the Lord ſayth, <hi>I haue paſſed by the fairenes of her necke,</hi> that is to ſay, I haue layd an honorable yoke vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and I my ſelfe would ride vpon that people as vpon mine owne pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and proper horſe for honor ſake decked and trimmed by me.

God therefore promiſeth that he will not execute vpon thoſe remnants of Ephraim, the puniſhments which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, and that he will not bee angrie againſt them, accordingly as their ſinnes doe prouoke his wrath. He will indeede puniſh them, but he will not ouerthrow them: the which notwithſtanding the iuſt and righteous heate of the vengeance of God againſt al ſinnes of men requireth to be done. God then will abate of his right, and in them the mercie of God ſhall triumph aboue iudgement. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he will not enter into their cities, to deſtroy them: but will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them both to be, and alſo to be inhabited by them. Theſe things firſt came to paſſe when as many of theſe ten tribes both vnder E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechias, and alſo Ioſias Kings of Iudah went vp to Ieruſalem vnto the Temple of God 2. Chro. 30. and 34. Secondly, vnder the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt, when as by his preaching God conuerted vnto him and ſaued the Iſraelites,<note place="margin">A twofold rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this promiſe.</note> and Galileans, and Samaritanes.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of this promiſe followeth, and the ſame two-fold. Firſt, from the nature of the true God, <hi>It is God</hi> that ſpeaketh theſe things,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1.</hi> From the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the true God.</note>

<pb n="517" facs="tcp:9718:239"/>againſt that which is changeable. And ſo doth Samuel reaſon againſt Saul touching the certaintie of the renting of the kingdome from him, becauſe God had ſo decreed, who is not changeable 1. Sam. 15.29. <hi>For indeed</hi> (ſayth Samuel) <hi>the ſtrength of Iſrael will not lye, nor repent: for he is not a man that he ſhould repent.</hi> So then looke what God hath once decreed touching the ſauing of his, the ſame is eſtabliſhed, and not to bee moued or changed. For God doth not change his ſentence and minde, as men change, and therefore Gods thoughts are not like vnto mens thoughts, as he himſelfe witneſſeth Iſai 55. ver. 8. where he ſayth: <hi>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your wayes my wayes.</hi> Finally, the gifts of God towards his are without repentance, as Paul writeth Rom. 11. ver. 29. <hi>For the gifts and calling of God are without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> God therefore will of his mercie preſerue thoſe that are his. Secondly,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> By the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and laying open of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by two titles or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</note> by the declaration of this nature of God is confirmed alſo that the remnants of Iſrael ſhall be ſaued. For as Paul Rom. 9. ver. 27. alleageth out of Iſai cap. 1. ver. 9. <hi>Though the number of Iſrael were as the ſand of the ſea, yet ſhall but a remnant be ſaued.</hi> For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it ſhould come to paſſe, that all Iſrael by reaſon of their ſinnes, ſhould be as Sodom, and Gomorah, as Iſaias in the former place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth. This nature of God is here declared by two titles and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the ſame, to wit: for that God is ſtrong, and holie. He is ſtrong, as namely whoſe decree and will no creature can let,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1.</hi> God is ſtrong.</note> no nor yet ſtay ſo much as one minute from execution in due &amp; iuſt time: for he remoueth all impediments or lets forthwith. Secondly, he is holie, yea, and that in the midſt of them, to ſanctifie them,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> God is holie.</note> and blot out their offences by Chriſt. For their ſinnes are they, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe doe ſtay the effect of GOD his mercie and promiſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſauing of thoſe remnants. But he which is holie, will ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie thoſe remnants: for to that end he is ſayd to be in the midſt of his elect and choſen, that he may ſanctifie them: and alſo that he may be ſanctified by them, that is, be ſerued and worſhipped. So then God will ſaue, and doth ſaue them for the keeping of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and glorie. And theſe two titles are in this place rehearſed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fitly, to anſwere the ſundrie obiections, the which doe come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mindes and conſciences of the godly, when as they do think of theſe promiſes of preſeruing them in the midſt of the ruine and going to decay of the world.</p>

And it is taken from the indignitie and haynouſnes of the matter, the which is ſhewed by the comparing together of the perſons, to wit, of theſe with their father Iſrael, or Iacob. Therfore in this place there is a compariſon made of the poſteritie with their aunceſtors and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and eſpecially with Iſrael their father, of whome they were wont greatly to glory and boaſt both within themſelues, and alſo amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g other people.

Therefore taking occaſion by the word <hi>Iſrael</hi> verſ. 1. and <hi>Iacob</hi> verſ. 3. there is ſhewed what hee did, how much hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, how much hee ſwet, that he might both ſerue and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that God,<note place="margin">The vertues of Iacob.</note> whom theſe his poſteritie forſooke and caſt away. Finally, here is deſcribed or ſet out with how great indeuour both of minde and body, yea and from the very inſtant and minute of his natiuity or birth, he diligently ſued and ſought after that ſame friendſhip and good will of the true God, that theſe his poſteritie may be made the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>Now there are three ſignes deſcribed, by the which it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, with how great earneſtnes of minde Iacob or Iſrael (for theſe are all one Gen. 32.28.) ſought, embraced, and retained the good wil, grace, and fauour of GOD. The firſt ſigne is, That when as he was yet with his brother Eſau in the womb of his mother, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> hee held the heele of his brother Eſau, that Eſau ſhould not come firſt out of the wombe, that is, that Eſau in reſpect of time ſhould not bee the firſt borne, and haue the bleſſing of God Gen. 25.26. <hi>After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:9718:243"/>came his brother out, and his hand held Eſau by the heele.</hi> Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as if Iacob thought very then when he was not yet borne into the light, of the preuenting or going before Eſau in the friendſhip and fauour of God, and of getting the grace of God from him, with ſo great a deſire ſoothles was he holden euen then (being as yet in the womb, and an infant) to win God on his ſide, and to embrace him notwithſtanding. For when as the bleſſing of God by all likelyhood was due vnto the firſt borne, this priuiledge of the birthright, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob went about to take from his brother euen then, like as hee did afterward Gen. 25. ver. 31. When he ſaid vnto him comming hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie home: <hi>Sel me euen now thy birth-right,</hi> that by this meanes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he might get the bleſſing of God from his brother, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh it vnto himſelfe. That which afterward came to paſſe Gen. 27. And albeit theſe things ſo fell out by reaſon that God had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde that ſo it ſhould be, as appeareth Gen. 25.23. <hi>The Elder ſhall ſerue the yonger,</hi> and by the election of God, who loued Iacob, and hated Eſau, Malach. 1. ver. 3. yet notwithſtanding is it true that theſe things alſo were done by Iacob in this ſort when he was yet a childe, according vnto the diſpenſation, and meaſure of his faith, the which being then an infant and yet vnborne, hee had notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding with God, like as it is written of Iohn the Baptiſt Luc. the 1. ver. 41. And of the Prophet Ieremie cap. 1. ver. 5. who were ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in the wombe of their mothers, and ordained vnto thoſe great matters the which God effected afterward by their miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. And all theſe things doe argue or proue the earneſtnes of Iacob in getting the fauour of God, and as it were foreſtalling of his grace, euen from his mothers wombe, and from the very firſt moment of his natiuitie or birth. The which notwithſtanding theſe Iſraelites, that is to ſay, his poſteritie did not imitate or follow: and therefore are they ſo much the worſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſigne is, that the ſame Iacob, as a moſt valiant prince, and moſt ſtrong and ſtout champion, fought againſt the Angel himſelfe, which ſeemed to bring ſome let vnto him, whileſt he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the charge of God concerning his returning into the land of Chanaan. This is deſcribed Gen. 31. ver. 3. where mention is made how God had ſaid vnto Iacob: <hi>Turne againe into the lande of thy fathers, and to thy kindred, and I will be with thee.</hi> And againe cap. 32. ver. 24. where Laban is charged from God not to hinder him in this courſe, and to <hi>ſpeake to Iacob nought ſaue good.</hi> Whereby appeareth howe great earneſtnes of minde there was in their father Iacob to
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:9718:244"/>ſerue God, to doe his commaundements, and finally to keepe his good will towards him continually. For he fought ſtoutly for the executing of the commandement of God, and that againſt an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, not onely againſt a mortall man: he fought long and much, and therein ſhewed that he had inuincible ſtrength to ſerue God, and that no labour was tedious vnto him. Therefore in that fight he appeared as a prince, and a moſt skilfull and valiant captaine, and not as a common ſouldier Gen. 32. ver. 28. Whereupon his name is changed, for the Angel ſaith vnto him: <hi>Thy name ſhall be called Iaacob no more, but Iſrael: becauſe thou haſt had power with God, thou ſhalt alſo preuaile with men.</hi> For in the ende he obtained the victorie and vpper hand euen againſt that Angel. Therefore he ruled, or ſhewed himſelfe a prince and ſtout wraſtler, ſtriuing for the truth and promiſes of God againſt the Angel. But this Angel was Chriſt, who alſo is called Iehouah hereafter ver. 5. For ſo is Chriſt often called the Captaine of his Church, and an Heade, and an Angel. So Eſay 9. ver. 6. among other titles giuen vnto our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, he is called, The prince of peace. So Iudg. 6. ver. 22. he is called an Angel: for there we finde thus: <hi>And when Gideon percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that it was an Angel of the Lorde, Gideon then ſaide, Alas, My Lord God: for becauſe I haue ſeene an Angel of the Lord face to face, I ſhall die.</hi> And this Angel fought with Iacob taking vpon him the ſhape of a man for a time. He fought with Iacob, that he might firſt tempt him, and afterwards confirme him in the faith of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and make him an inuincible or vnconquerable champion. And the Angel ſuffereth himſelfe to be ouercome, becauſe he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe gaue ſtrength vnto Iacob ſighting with him, to ouercome him. Moreouer Iacob became lame of that fight, to the ende hee ſhould vnderſtand that he ouercame not by his owne ſtrength, or by his owne ſtrength gat the vpper hand of the Angel. Let vs alſo hope for the ſame things at the hand of God, ſo often as he fighteth louingly againſt vs. For he doth this to confirme or ſtrengthen vs: and not to bring vs into tentation in his iuſt iudgement, that wee ſhould be ouercome of euill. And therefore Dauid ſaith vnto God Pſal. 26. ver. 2. <hi>Prooue me, O Lord, and trie me: examine my reynes, and mine heart.</hi> And Iames teacheth the faithfull that this kinde of tentation or triall which God vſeth towardes thoſe that are his, <hi>bringeth forth patience.</hi> cap. 1. ver. 3.</p>

Wherfore the vertues of our auncetors are diligently of vs to be conſidered. For they are home examples, the which doe make vs inexcuſable, except we doe imitate or follow them. And it is the third ſigne, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> whereby Iſrael de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his earneſtnes, and contention or ſtriuing in minde in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the fauour of God, to wit, for that he deſired the bleſſing of God euen with teares and weeping. The which were in Iacob moſt aſſured tokens of this moſt earneſt affection. This is reported Gen. 32. ver. 26. and 29. Laſt of all he got the ſame bleſſing of God, and receiueth teſtimonie or witnes thereof from God, not once, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, as then when hee ſtroue with the Angel, as I haue ſaid, Gen. 32.28. and afterwardes in Beth-el, Gen. 35.10. For the new name he receiued in token of the fauour of God towards him, the which name was giuen him by God himſelfe. For in ſtead of Iacob he was named by God, <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a very high and royal name.<note place="margin">The Prince, or Champion of God.</note> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was that ſame talke and teſtimonie of God with Iſrael, giuen onely for the ſake, or in reſpect of Iſrael, but alſo for his whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities ſake which ſhould be borne of him, that his poſteritie might vnderſtand that they alſo ſhould be bleſſed of God, that they ſhould be ſtrong and happie in God, ſo that they would ſhew and retaine the ſame earneſtnes in ſeeking of God, the which Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob their progenitor and originall of their ſtocke vſed.

For the more that ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie reigneth among men, ſo much the more ſhamefully and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly the true worſhip of God is either defaced or taken away, and the knowledge of the true God is aboliſhed.

Further, the ſeruice of Iacob for a wife is twice ſet downe in this verſe, both to make the matter more plaine, and what kinde of ſeruice it was: and alſo for as much as Iacob had two wiues, he ſerued for them both ſeuerally, and at diuers times.

Finally, they ſhall become a tale, and an hiſſing to the common people, as the holy ſcripture ſpeaketh.

<pb n="539" facs="tcp:9718:250"/>For this whole chapter tendeth to this end, to ſhew that God will bee fauourable to the remnants of this people of Iſrael, the which ſhall conuert or turne vnto God, and ſhal in the end gather them together of his great mercie, and call them back againe vnto him, ver. 14.15. albeit that the moſt ſhamefull and filthie ſinnes of this people doe not at all deſerue this, or perſwade hereunto. In the meane ſeaſon God by all meanes, and by reaſons taken from all places calleth back all the Iſraelites, that is to ſay, the ten tribes, the which had treacherouſlie withdrawne themſelues from his true worſhip, that if by any meanes it might be, God might ſaue them all and not a part onely, and remnant of them. And by theſe admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions or warnings ſo often repeated the Iſraelites are made the leſſe excuſable, and their diſobedience is ſhewed to be the greater, and the more ſtubborne. Wherfore in this chapter God exhorteth and calleth the whole nation vnto repentance: and in this verſe he dooth it by the rehearſing of both their eſtates, to wit, that in the which this people was, &amp; flouriſhed ſo long as they ſerued the true God, or was not ſo much giuen vnto idolatrie (as it was then) and of that ſtate, in which they now be, after that they haue begun to worſhip idols ſo outragiouſlie, and thoſe alſo of all ſortes.<note place="margin">The first eſtate of the Ephrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites.</note> As for their firſt eſtate, it was happie: For then, <hi>When Ephraim ſpake,</hi> and gaue ſentence among the other tribes, <hi>they were feared.</hi> For they had gotten vnto themſelues reuerence and authoritie among all the Iſraelites, in ſo much that they obtained the kingdome among thoſe ten tribes, and that this tribe of Ephraim made the other tribes to feare them, and ruled ouer them as their head. For Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam (which firſt ordained and ſet vp the kingdome of Iſrael) was an Ephraimite 1. King. 11. ver. 26. &amp; he made the citie Sichem the chiefe citie of that Kingdome, in mount Ephraim, in the which afterward he and Nadab reigned and dwelled 1. King. 12.25. <hi>Then Ieroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein, and went from thence, and built Penuel.</hi> But after that the familie of Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam was rooted out, and the kingdome taken by Baaſa of the tribe of Iſſachar 1. King. 15. ver. 27. the ſeate of the kingdome and the chiefe citie was Therſa or Tirza, ver. 33. And this Therſa or Tirza was beyond Iordan, in the countrie of Galaad, or Gilead neer vnto Thapſus 2. King. 15. ver. 16. And Thapſus or Tiphſah, (which of Stephanus is called Thapſacus, and of Plinius lib. 5. cap. 24. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phipolis) is ſituate by the riuer Euphrates, at leaſtwiſe beyond Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan 1. King. 4. ver. 24. For there it is ſaid that <hi>Solomon ruled in all the
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:9718:251"/>region on the other ſide of the riuer, from Tiphſah euen vnto Azzah, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore the authoritie and preheminence of the tribe of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim was now in part diminiſhed,<note place="margin">The autoritie of the tribe of Ephraim in part dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</note> when as the chiefe citie of the kingdome was tranſlated into another tribe. And this came to paſſe, becauſe thoſe two Ephraimite kings, namely Ieroboam and Nadab were idolators. And this was the firſt condition or eſtate of Ephraim, and the ſame in deede happie, before that it fell vnto idolatrie.</p>
                     <p>But after that outragious and filthie idolatrie began among them,<note place="margin">The ſecond e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraimites.</note> and the worſhip of Baal, and all kinde of idols to bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and worſhipped for God, then began Ephraim to be moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie, to be counted weake, and for dead, and of no authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the other tribes. That which happened firſt vnder King A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab. For he firſt brought Baalims into Iſrael ſeeking to pleaſe his wife Iezabel of Sidonia 1. King. 16. ver. 31.<note place="margin">Achab was the firſt that brought Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alims into Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</note> For there by way of admiration it is aſked thus concerning him: <hi>For was it a light thing for him to walke in the ſinnes of Ieroboam the ſonne of Nebat, except he tooke Iezabel alſo the daughter of Eth-baal King of the Zidonians to wife, and went and ſerued Baal, and worſhiped him?</hi> And thus hee worſe prouoked God then all the former Kings of Iſrael. Finally, he opened a window vnto all kinde of idolatrie, were it neuer ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd or againſt reaſon, and blaſphemous. For that which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined and ſet vp by Ieroboam, might ſeeme to haue ſome colour and excuſe, for that Aaron in the wildernes did ſet vp and caſt a calfe for the Iſraelites, whom the people themſelues worſhipped Exod. 32. ver. 4.5. For whon the molten calfe was made and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, then they ſaid: <hi>Theſe bee thy gods, O Iſrael, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, when Aaron ſaw that, he made an altar before it, &amp;c. and they offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, &amp;c.</hi> But the worſhip of Baalims could not be defended by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny home example of the Iſraelites, and it was altogether profane or filthie, and heatheniſh. Whereupon euen from that time eſpecially the matters and ſtrength of the Iſraelites began to goe to wracke and to bee diminiſhed and troubled by the Syrians and Arabians. For Achab himſelfe with his armie was ſlaine by Benadad the King of the Syrians at the citie Ramoth Gilead,<note place="margin">Achab ſlaine at Ramoth Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead, by Bena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad King of Syria.</note> when as he would haue taken it againe, and recouered it out of the hands of the Syrians, which had gotten and taken it before. Afterward alſo their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er began to decay vnder the other kings of the Iſraelites: there were ciuill warres, and daily murtherings one of another among them:
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:9718:251"/>laſtly, the eſtate of this nation was miſerable and pittifull, and they themſelues were laid open for a pray vnto their neighbours. Their ſtrength was ſo ſmall, or rather none at all, as is the ſtrength of a dead man. Samaria in deed was alwaies the chiefe citie of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome 1. King. 16. This ſeemeth to haue been ſituate in the tribe of Ephraim: or at leaſt wiſe in that countrie, the which was common vnto the tribe of Ephraim, and the halfe tribe of Manaſſes, and therefore a certaine kingly and royall dignitie might yet ſtill bee thought to remaine in the tribe of Ephraim: but yet now at this time the ſtrength of that kingdome was very ſmall. And therefore it was a name without a bodie, or onely a bare ſhadow of a great name, as one ſaith of old Pompeius.</p>

                     <p>THe firſt amplification of the idolatrie of the Iſraelites, that the complaint of God, and the puniſhment of this ſinne may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be the more iuſt. It is amplified fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> three places, &amp; ſhewed how great hurt there commeth thereby, that the Iſraelites being warned by their owne puniſhment and harme may be called back vnto repentance, if ſo bee that they can bee called back.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1.</hi> From their continuance in idolatrie.</note> The firſt 02 place is taken from their continuance in idolatrie. For after that they once tooke vpon them the worſhip of Baalims, the Iſraelites grew and waxed worſe and worſe. Thus doubtles doe they alwaies fall to worſe and worſe, which haue once caſt away the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. They frame vnto themſelues euery day new idols, they be at new charges, they beſtowe waſtefully vpon theſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions euery their beſt and moſt pretious things. And finally this their dooing hath no meane nor meaſure. For a windowe being once opened vnto idolatrie, men run daylie into new worſhippings of new Gods: and as euery new religion beſt liketh them, or is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by them according to the pleaſure of their minde, ſo doe they receiue and ſet it vp: as it is done at this day in the popedome, where there are daily new orders of Monkes, new feaſt dayes, new Saints, new Patrons ariſe vp, and are receiued. Therefore <hi>according vnto their vnderstanding, and owne pleaſure,</hi> the Iſraelites doe daily caſt
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:9718:252"/>and melt new images, and that of ſiluer.</p>

                           <hi>2.</hi> From the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their idols.</note>The ſecond place of amplification is from the multitude of their idols. For they admit and receiue euery idoll for God. For idolators are not content with the Gods, which they alreadie know: but by what kinde of crafteſman ſoeuer a new forme and ſhape of an idol is forged, painted, made, how fond, euill fauoured, ſtrange ſoeuer it be, the ſame notwithſtanding do idolators allow by and by, ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily take vp and receiue, and worſhip, although it be the worke of a man, yea and a mortall man, and alſo a dumme and a dead worke.

And this confutation is manifold. Firſt, from the moſt ancient and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, or eſpeciall couenant of God with this people: and againe from the moſt holie and ancient promiſe of this people. For God had peculiarly choſen this people for his owne, and ſeuered them out from others, and promiſed that he would be their God, euen from the very deliuering of this people out of the land of Egypt: and on the other ſide this people had by a mutuall couenant &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe vndertaken that they would be the people of this God onely.

<pb n="544" facs="tcp:9718:253"/>800. yeares. Wherefore the more old and ancient this couenant of God and the people within themſelues was, ſo much the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently and holily ought it of them to bee kept, that this people ſhould not worſhip any other God. And therefore ſhould caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all idols. See before cap. 12. ver. 10. And therefore Pſal. 81. ver. 8, 9, 10. God giueth them an earneſt charge concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and promiſeth them plentiful bleſſings, if forſaking all other gods they will cleaue onely vnto him, ſaying: <hi>Heare, O my people, and I will proteſt vnto thee: O Iſrael, if thou wilt hearken vnto me, and wilt haue no ſtrange god in thee, neither worſhip any ſtrange god (for I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt) open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi> For, as I haue ſayd, then there had paſſed a couenant on both ſides betweene God and this people, a ſolemne ceremonie and oth being made betweene them, by how much the ſinne of this people not keeping the promiſe by them ſo ſolemnly made, was the greater. And God alſo in Chriſt hath made a couenant with vs at this day, and hath choſen vs pecullarly for his people, which Chriſt (as Paul witneſſeth Tit. 2.14.) <hi>gaue himſelfe for vs, that he might redeeme vs from all iniquitie, and purge vs to bee a peculiar people to himſelfe, zealous of good workes.</hi>

And the benefite (whereof mention is made in this place) is the care the which God had ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dwelling in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe by the whole ſpace of 40. yeres. For God fed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there by
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:9718:253"/>ſo many yeares, and that with meate from heauen, he kept them in health ſafe and ſound, yea during all that long time and iourney he ſaued their garments alſo and their ſhooes whole, and from wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. So Moſes telleth them Deut. 8. ver. 4. ſaying: <hi>Thy rayment waxed not old vpon thee, neither did thy foote ſwell thoſe fortie yeares.</hi> And God himſelfe cap. 29. ver. 5. in theſe words: <hi>And I haue led you fortie yeares in the wilderneſſe: your clothes are not waxed old vpon you, neither is thy ſhooe waxed old vpon thy foote.</hi> The greatneſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of this benefite of God is declared by the circumſtance of the place, and the ſame two-fold. For it was both a deſert, and alſo a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hot and drie countrie. And therefore when the people murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for want of water for them and cattel to drinke, God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Moſes to ſtrike the rocke, and water guſhed out for the people to drinke Exod. 17. ver. 6. God nouriſhed them notwithſtanding in that ſame deſert or wilderneſſe, to wit of Arabia,<note place="margin">The deſert of Arabia.</note> where want of all things and meates feareth all men, and is ſeene. For among all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſerts and rough vntilled and barraine places of the whole world, this one wilderneſſe of Arabia is moſt terrible, huge, wide, &amp; wanting all things needfull to liue withall. So Moſes deſcribeth it Deut. 8. ver. 15. when he ſheweth that God was their guide there <hi>in the great and terrible wilderneſſe (wherein were firie ſerpents &amp; ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, and drought, where was no water, who brought forth water for them out of the rocke of flint.</hi> With this agreeth Dionyſius Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in his Deſcription of the world, and Ierome in the life of Hiba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, in ſo much that thoſe which trauaile that way euen at this day, are conſtrained to carrie with them ſo many dayes meate as the iourney of that wilderneſſe is long.

The Iſraelites therefore deſired for themſelues a King, and Princes to raigne ouer them by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſucceſſion, the which after the manner of other Princes, ſhould haue the ſuperioritie and rule ouer them, ſhould order their bottels, and defend them from forraine enemies, as if there were not ayde enough in thoſe iudges, the which God for the time rayſed vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that is to ſay, they did put more truſt in mortall men, then in the one and eternall God, and ſeeke for more ayde and helpe at their hand, then they did from God. And therefore 1 Sam. cap. 8.
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:9718:256"/>ver. 20. being wearie of their iudges, they make anſwer vnto him, <hi>Nay, but there ſhall be a king ouer vs, and we alſo will be like all other nations, and our King ſhall iudge vs, and goe out before vs, and fight our battailes.

So it is ſaid, <hi>The people periſheth, becauſe they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge</hi> Iſay. 5. ver. 13.

And why Micheas had neede of ſo earneſt a confirmation of his doctrine, beſides that (which is contained in the former verſe) this is a reaſon, for that he had to doe with both kingdomes, and not with one alone: as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos delt only with the Iſraelites, Sophonias onely with the Iewes.

                           <hi>1</hi> The matter it ſelfe: to wit, the fearefull fleeing of the whole nation.</note> As for the matter, it is the moſt fearfull fleeing and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away of that whole nation, ſometime moſt braue and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and well tilled by the Iſraelites. For I ſuppoſe the things which the Prophet here ſpeaketh to belong vnto the Iſraelites, and not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iewes. For their deſtruction, and not the Iewes, is here now properly deſcribed: yea, and whereas there is in this place mention made of Ieruſalem, and of the citie <hi>Lachis,</hi> this is not rehearſed for it ſelfe, but onely to amplifie the ruine of the ouerthrow threatned vnto the Iſraelites. Therefore the places which are here called both <hi>Saphirical,</hi> that is to ſay, beautiful, pleaſant, fine: and <hi>Zaanana,</hi> that is, paſture grounds, and full of cattell, I doe thinke the ſame to be to be referred vnto the kingdom of Iſrael, &amp; not vnto the kingdom of Iudah, becauſe that that the ſame kingdom of Iſrael was alſo moſt rich, fruitfull, and hauing ſtore of all things, as was alſo the kingdom of Iudah. For it alſo was a part of the land promiſed by God vnto the children of Iſrael, and ſo conſequently bleſſed, albeit that at the ſame time the Iſraelites had caſt away the true worſhip of God. It appeareth by the diuiſion of the land deſcribed in the booke of Ioſhua, and by cap. 4. of the firſt booke of Kings, that there were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing vnto this kingdome of Iſrael, both moſt fruitfull places, and alſo fine and beautifull places.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Antitheſis</hi> or contrarietie, the which is manifeſtly ſeene in this ſentence of the Prophet,<note place="margin">

For the farmers, and tillers of farmes in the countrie haue them for the moſt part of the citie ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners hired for a rent, or for a reward, vnles that they themſelues bee rich, and the owners of them. But the Prophets meaning is, that thoſe farmers, which ſhall hold theſe farmes of them, ſhal not meet them when they flee away, that they may refreſh and helpe their Landlords. The reaſon is added, becauſe that the husbandmen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo awhaped, and frighted, ſhall not doe it for feare, ſo that they ſhall not dare to goe out of their rockes, fields, and farmes. For, ſaith the Prophet, <hi>there ſhall be mourning,</hi> and it ſhall bee heard euery where, both in the places and houſes, the which ſhall be adioyning, and neere vnto theſe farmes. Finally, both in the townes, and in the fields there ſhall be great feare, great trembling, great diſmaying &amp; abaſhment, ſo that not ſo much as the countrie ſeruants, who in their farmes haue their foode and dwelling of their maſters, ſhall come out of thoſe their farmes and houſes to comfort and meete their maſters, nor to bring them any helpe at all, when as they ſlee, and paſſe by that way.

Firſt, who threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.

So then look at what moment and minute of time we doe deuiſe vpon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of ſinnes within our ſelues, GOD alſo doth deuiſe with himſelfe vpon our puniſhment.

                           <hi>2.</hi> To whom this puniſhment is threatned.</note> to wit, vnto the whole houſe of Iacob, and coneſquently as well to the Iewes, as vnto the Iſraelites: albeit that he begin firſt with the Iſraelites, as being more manifeſtly guiltie, and wicked. Thirdly, what euil, or what puniſhment God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto both peoples.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>3.</hi> What puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t god threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto them</note> And he threatneth a moſt lamentable puniſhment, the which ſhall holde them as it were by the necke, halter, and ſtrangle them, that is to ſay, whereby they ſhall periſh miſerably, and ſhamefully, howſoeuer they haue liued licentiouſly
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:9718:279"/>and atrandon before, as wanton agaynſt God, vnbridled, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any bandes.

So that now, except they repent, all ſecurity and hope of eſcaping is taken away from them. Fourthly, there is here alſo contained an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification of this puniſhment taken from the effect. And this is,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>4.</hi> An amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the effect</note> that after this puniſhment they ſhall neuer goe, or doe ſo proudly as before, and ſo renowmed and glorious.

Therefore I take the worde <hi>(Romah)</hi> in good parte in this place. This to bee true, that which fell out vnto them, hath declared. For the kingdome of Iſrael vtterly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed: and the kingdome of Iudah was neuer afterward reſtored vnto his former glory &amp; renowme, no not after their return from the captiuitie of Babylon, as may appeare Ezechiel 21. verſ. 26, 27. of that which is threatned concerning the fall of Zedekiah, and his Kingdome, neuer to be reſtored to his former dignity in theſe wordes: <hi>Thus ſayth the Lorde GOD, I will take away the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, and take off the Crowne: this ſhall be no more the ſame: I will exalte the humble and abaſe him that is high.

This then was the exception of this people, and the ſame ſpringing from notorious impudencie or ſhameleſnes &amp; contumacie or ſtubbornnes againſt God, to wit, The Prophets ſhal not propheſie among vs, that is to ſay, wee will not ſuffer them to threaten theſe things vnto vs, yea, if any meſſenger of ſuch feare &amp; threatnings ſhall come vnto vs, we will ſend him packing, and will not ſuffer him to ſpeake, to terrifie or feare our men. So Amos 7. ver. 12, 13. Amaziah ſayth vnto Amos, <hi>O thou ſeer, goe, flee thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into the land of Iudah, and there eate thy bread, and propheſie there: but propheſie no more at Bethel: for it is the Kings chappel, and it is the Kings court.</hi> So Iſai. 30. ver. 10. The people ſay vnto the Seers, <hi>See not: and to the Prophets, propheſie not to vs right things: but ſpeake flattering things vnto vs, propheſie errors.</hi> This was paſſing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes againſt God, and blockiſhnes vnheard of, as if God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could be letted in his worke, becauſe ſome ſtoppes and lets are layd in the way of his miniſters, and for that they are forbidden to threaten thoſe iudgements of God by the vngodly.

                        </note> Firſt, nay the Prophets of God ſhall preach and propheſie among you, in ſpite of your teeth, and in your hearing notwithſtanding. Hereof there is example 1. King. cap. 22. ver. 8. in the Prophet Michaiah, who tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the trueth, notwithſtanding the wicked King Achab hate him neuer ſo much, and cannot abide to heare him. And Amos 7. ver. 16. the Prophet ceaſeth not to denounce God his iudgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Amaziah the prieſt, albeit he were forbidden by him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie in the land of Iſrael.

Therefore in my iudgement the ſecond
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:9718:280"/>part of this verſe is an interrogation, or asking of a queſtion thus: If the Prophets propheſie not (to wit, as being ſtopped and letted by one meanes or other) ſhall they therefore (namely the people) not take ſhame? And it is eaſily vnderſtood, what the Prophet would haue vnderſtood, to wit, This people ſhall not therefore bee free from the puniſhment to come, although they will not haue the Prophets of God to threaten the ſame vnto them.

For they call themſelues the houſe of Iaacob,
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:9718:281"/>and ſuch alſo they will haue themſelues accounted for to bee: yea they are ſo termed of other people. And by this name they doe ſhew that they are come of Iacob the ſeruant of God, and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, that they are his ſeede and familie bleſſed and choſen of God before or aboue others, &amp; who therefore ought the more to knowe and reuerence God.

For in that age eſpeciallie wherein Micheas propheſied the Iſraelites were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed vnto ciuill warres among themſelues. Further he ſeemeth to call againe to remembrance that example of crueltie, the which the Iſraelites lately had ſhewed againſt the Iewes their brethren and neighbours, when as they ſpoyled and carried away of them two hundreth thouſand perſons, that is, of men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, one with another, without al pittie or mercy.

Although it appeare out of other Prophets that the ſame vices raigned alſo among the Iewes, as Dauid Pſal. 14.4. complaining that all things generally were out of frame in all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, ſayth: <hi>Doe not all the workers of iniquitie knowe that they eate vp my people, as they eate breade? they call not vpon the Lord.</hi> Now Micheas in order after that he hath generally deſcribed the ſinnes of the whole people, nowe ſheweth peculiarly the notorious wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of the Princes, vnto whom therefore he doth alſo threaten the greater and more heauy iudgements of God. For princes by their vertue and godlines ought to ſhine as lights vnto the people.

And the maner of this ſpoyling, the which by them is vſed, is moſt cruell and barbarous. For they teare away the skinne, and the fleſh, and the bones of the people, as butchers and ſlaughter men doe, and when they cut them, they teare them aſunder with a noyſe and ratling, &amp; ſlay them with violence and force, as the moſt cruell butchers, and

For ſuch a crying is like vnto the teares of Eſau, as namely, being cauſed of the only feeling of puniſhment, not of any faith, or loue vnto God: not ſpringing of any earneſt motion of penitencie, or affection of repentance: and therefore it is not heard of God.

The which things in this place are ſayd and rehearſed by Micheas not for vaine glorie and boaſting, but for the ſake of his miniſterie, and for to defend the trueth of God. So Paul, to confirme the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt which he preached, ſpeaketh many things chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of himſelfe, and of his dignitie &amp; vnderſtanding 2.

So Paul 2. Cor. 10. <hi>But we will not reioyce of things which are not within our meaſure, but according to the meaſure of the line, wherof God hath diſtributed vnto vs a meaſure to attaine euen vnto you.</hi> And cap. 12. ver. 12. <hi>The ſignes of an Apoſtle were wrought among you with all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, with ſignes and wonders, and great workes.</hi> Now theſe effects of the calling of our Prophet are generally the fulfilling therof, that is, That Micheas hath gifts neceſſarie for that charge. And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, vnderſtanding, or iudgement, and conſtancie, and both theſe from the ſpirit of God. Wherby is gathered, that in reſpect of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or vnderſtanding; the true Prophets of God did ſpeake farre more certainlie, diſtinctly, plainly, and cleerely, then the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did ſpeake. In reſpect of their conſtancie, they had not the people ſo fauourable vnto them, as the falſe Prophets had. For theſe falſe Prophets ſoothed the people in their ſinnes, and therefore were acceptable vnto them: but the true Prophets did earneſtly &amp; ſharply rebuke vices, &amp; therefore they were counted troubleſome, and hated. For it is an old ſaying and true, Flatterie getteth friends, but trueth hatred And Paul 2. Tim. 4. ver. 3. teacheth, <hi>That the time will come, when they will not ſuffer wholeſome doctrine: but hauing their eares itching, ſhall after their owne luſts get them an heape of teachers and ſhall turne their eares from the trueth, and ſhall be giuen vnto fables.</hi> Wherefore Galat. 4. ver. 16. he asketh them, ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>Further, in this ſelfe ſame verſe there appeareth a manifeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:9718:289"/>of this <hi>iudgement,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">An example of that iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſayth was giuen him by God.</note> the which Micheas ſayth to haue been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him by God, whildſt that he doth not call the iniquitie of Iacob, that is, of the Iewes, and that of the Iſraelites, al by one name: but ſayth that in theſe there is only ſinne, in the other alſo wickedneſſe, that is, greater ſinne. For the fault of the Iewes ſinning againſt God, was greater then the Iſraelites: becauſe that there remained a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter light among the Iewes, and that the benefits of God were more in number towards them, then towards the Iſraelites. Therefore this ſo perfect and true diſtinction or difference of ſinnes in both people, argueth or ſheweth that the diſcretion, knowledge, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding which by God was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto Micheas, was very great, and conſequently that he came vnto this office taught and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Spirit of God.

<pb n="632" facs="tcp:9718:298"/>promiſe vnto her a kingdome, but alſo ſuch a one as it had before, to wit, vnder Dauid and Salomon. For Saul is not here to bee rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among the kings, when as he was not giuen of God, but ſet vp, and asked by the people. So then it ſhal be a notable kingdom, moſt large, flouriſhing, rich, peaceable, fearefull vnto the nations, nay ſuch alſo as ſhall ſubdue the nations, and bring them vnder her ſubiection. The Church long ſithence hath enioyed theſe things, and doth alſo at this day enioy them through Chriſt, and by the preaching of the Goſpel Pſal. 2. And Luk. 1. verſ. 32, 33. the Angel doth foretell of this flouriſhing eſtate of Chriſt his ſpirituall kingdome, ſaying: <hi>He ſhall be great, and ſhall be called the ſonne of the moſt high and the Lord God ſhall giue vnto him the throne of his father Dauid, and he ſhall raigne ouer the houſe of Iacob for euer, and of his kingdome ſhall be none ende.</hi> And this is ſignified alſo by the ſubmiſſion and reuerence of the 24. Elders Reuelat. 4. verſ. 10. <hi>The foure and twenty Elders feldown before him that ſate on the throne, and worſhipped him that liueth for euermore, and caſt their crownes before the throne, &amp;c.</hi> And this ſo happie an eſtate is not promiſed vnto euery company of men,<note place="margin">The true church marked out from other aſſemblies of men by ſundry titles.</note> but only vnto the true Church of GOD. Therfore it is here by the Prophet diligently diſtinguiſhed or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out from other congregations of men by ſundry epithets or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, to wit, it is called <hi>The towre of the flocke,</hi> becauſe that in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 02 the ſame towre was then chiefly to be ſeen aboue others, being ſcituated neere vnto the market and gate of the ſheepe, and the poole of the ſheepe,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1</hi> The towre of the flocke.</note> (whereof mention is made Iohn 5. verſ. 2.) and the ſcituation of the whole citie it ſelf was on a high place. Therfore both of the ſcituation of the place and alſo of this part the whole citie of Ieruſalem is called a towre, and therefore the true Church of God is ſignified thereby, whereof Ieruſalem was at that time the houſe, and a figure of the Church of the Goſpel which ſhould bee afterward. So Eſai 29 Ieruſalem of the forme of the citie, is called <hi>Ariel,</hi> that is, a Lyon. Alſo the Church is called here <hi>The mount of the daughter Sion,</hi> becauſe that the ſame hill of the which hee now ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2</hi> The mount or ſtrong hold of the daughter Sion.</note> was the higheſt place of the whole citie knowen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euery man, and compaſſed and cloſed about with a wall for the defence and ſtrengthening of the citie 2. Chron. 27. verſ. 3. and 33. verſ. 4. Nehem. 3.26. Laſt of all, the Church is here called the daughter of Ieruſalem, and not the daughter of euery citie whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.

For not onely
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:9718:304"/>Chriſt, but alſo the Church hath authoritie and gouernement. But Chriſt of himſelfe as God, hath it. But the Church as receiuing it from Chriſt.

                     <p>This verſe hath three things to bee noted. Firſt, to whom this power is promiſed,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>3.</hi> Things to be noted.</note> to wit, to the remnant onely of Iacob, and not vnto that whole people, which boaſt themſelues to be the ſeede of Iacob.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1</hi> To whom this power is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> For not whoſoeuer are of the ſeede of Iacob, the ſame are the Sonnes of Iacob Rom. 9. ver. 6.7. But they which imbrace the faith of Iacob, and thoſe are they which are in deede godly and faithfull, the which both in this place and euery where in the holy Scriptures are fignified vnder the name of a Remnant, leaſt the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites might ſuppoſe the promiſes, and this power to appertaine vnto them. Secondly, there is to be noted what he promiſeth in this place,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> What is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</note> namely, a moſt ſweete effect of the power of the church to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes thoſe that are godly in deede in euery nation. The which conſiſteth herein, that the Church, or God by the ſpirituall worde doth in all places nouriſh them, feede them, giue them ſtrength to increaſe, comfort them: Finally, performeth the ſelfe ſame vſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, the which the rayne or ſmall dewe, and gliſtering in the fieldes bringeth either vnto the graſſe, when it firſt peepeth out of the ground, or when as it is alreadie growne forth. The like ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude is elſe where vſed in the Scriptures, as Pſal. 72. ver. 6. <hi>He ſhall come downe like the rayne vpon the mowen graſſe, and as the ſhowres that water the earth.</hi> So Pſalm 65. ver 9. <hi>Thou viſitest the earth, and waterest it: thou makest it very rich: the Riuer of God is full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: thou preparest them corne: for ſo thou appointest it. Thou wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:9718:304"/>aboundant lie the furrowes thereof: thou cauſest the rayne to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into the valleyes thereof: thou makest it ſoft with ſhowres, and bleſſest the bud thereof.</hi> And this doth the Church performe vnto the godly, by the diſpoſing and preaching of the word of God, whereof it is the keeper and pillar, as Paul ſpeaketh 1. Tim. 3.15. and in reſpect that it hath the externall or outward miniſterie thereof, to wit by ordeining of true and faithll Paſtors. <hi>Theſe things if thou doe</hi> ſaith Paul, <hi>thou ſhalt ſaue thy ſelfe and others.</hi> 1. Tim. 4. ver. 16. And Rom. 1.16. <hi>The gospell is the power of God vnto ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Otherwiſe the power and vertue it ſelfe, which inwardly dooth nouriſh vs, comfort vs, and giueth increaſe, is properly from God, and is the Spirit of God, and commeth not from the church as Paul teacheth 1. Cor. 3. ver. 7. ſaying: <hi>So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, neither hee that watreth, but God that giueth the increaſe.</hi> And the Prophet amplifieth this effect of the power of the church toward the godly from the kinde of rayne whereunto he compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it: For this power of the church is like not vnto euery raine: but vnto that which alone without the labour of men, that are vine dreſſers, gardeners, and husbandmen, without their trauaile and diligence I ſay nouriſheth, bringeth foorth, and ſtrengtheneth the graſſe &amp; herbes that ſpring out of the earth. The which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les is a moſt powerfull and plentifull vertue of rayne. So dooth the Church feede the godly with the word of GOD alone, not mingling therewith, or vſing any doctrine of men. Otherwiſe as touching the ſeruice and miniſterie of men that preach the goſpell, the ſame doubtles is neceſſarie in the church of God, and at no hand to be taken away: neither is it in this place condemned. For how ſhall they heare except there bee thoſe that preach, ſaith Paul, how ſhall they preach, except there bee ſome miniſterie or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined? But in this place is ſhewed that the word of God alone is ſufficient throughly to nouriſh the godly, to ſhut out any other kinde of doctrine whatſoeuer, ſuch as are the traditions of men: and not to take away the meanes of expounding the ſame worde of God, ſuch as are the faithfull Paſtors: For things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained one vnder another are not contrarie. Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>3.</hi> Among whom the Church ſhall haue and ſhew this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> it is to bee noted, among whome the Church ſhall haue and ſhew this power, to wit among the nations, that is, people ſtrangers before from true faith, and the heauenly doctrine: nay moreouer reſiſting and ſtriuing againſt it, yea and that among many nations, that is,
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:9718:305"/>diuers or many, that is, ſtrong and more honorable then others. Truely the Goſpell when as it was preached did winne and bring vnto Chriſt both many nations, and the ſame alſo moſt mighty, as for example, the kingdomes of the Romanes, and Perſians.</p>

For God hath ſhewed it vnto thee. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It is deſcribed by the forme, for it is wholly contayned in the law of God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in the which God himſelfe hath ſet downe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto mortall men, what things are good: that is, both holy and religious, and alſo what things are iuſt, and to be giuen vnto our neighbour. For it is not without an emphaſis, vehemencie or
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:9718:311"/>force that the Prophet ſayth here in this place, <hi>O man, God hath ſhewed thee.</hi> For the maieſtie of God is manifeſtly oppoſed or ſet agaynſt the condition of man. And it is a meere ſacriledge of men, or a robbing of God of his honour, when as men reiect or caſt away the things which God ſpeaking plainely from heauen hath taught, and doe follow their owne deuiſes, or had rather haue and doe preferre other things before them, as being more true then they. Wherefore that forme, after which the lawe of God teacheth that we ought to liue, is a moſt true remedie of changing of our life, and of appeaſing and pacifiyng of God. And the Prophet addeth a reaſon, whereby men may be brought hereunto, to wit, if they bee humbled before God, and become ſubiect vnto him, namely, laying aſide all pride of minde, and that ſame carnall wiſdome, wherewith they ſwell, and by meanes whereof all hypocrites doe pleaſe themſelues in their vices, and wicked life. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Laſtly, the kinds alſo of this remedie are here expreſſed alſo, that all excuſe may be taken away from them.<note place="margin">The law of God abridged by the Prophet vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to two points.</note> For when as the law of God hath many heads and branches, and precepts or commaundements, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet bringeth all vnto two poynts, leſt they might complaine, that the ſame were too hard, or darke,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iudgement.</hi>

                        </note> that is, performe both theſe poynts not vnwillingly, but of ſayth, and with a willing minde. Vnder the name of <hi>Iudgement</hi> he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth whatſoeuer we men doe owe vnto men by bargaine, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, couenant, or by the law written. Hee calleth clemencie or <hi>Mercie,</hi> whatſoeuer men doe owe vnto men by the generall duety of humanitie or manhood, in reſpect that they are men, and fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Galat. 6. Rom. 13. verſ. 8. as Paul willeth ſaying: <hi>Owe nothing to any man, but to loue one another: for he that loueth another, hath fulfilled the law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By <hi>Mercy,</hi> I ſay, he vnderſtandeth whatſoeuer we do owe one to another euen without any eſpeciall or peculiar couenant, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, and contract.

So doth Paul Rom 13. verſ 9. fſeaking of the fulfilling of the lawe by loue reckon vp the workes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the ſecond table onely, ſaying: <hi>For this, Thou ſhalt not committe adultery, Thou ſhalt not Kill, Thou ſhalt not ſteale, Thou ſhalt not beare falſe witneſſe, Thou ſhalt not couet: and if there bee

But why ſhould not God doe theſe things, who in the name of Chriſt hath giuen vnto his elect, and faythfull men the power to bring this thing to paſſe? For Mat. 17. ver. 20.

Touching the obiection, it might ariſe in their mindes after this maner, That God handled his owne people neuer a whit more mildly then his enemies, and theſe Aſſyrians. For when as the condition and eſtate of the people of Iſrael was moſt miſerable and afflicted, as who had not once only, but twiſe been almoſt vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroyed by God: Firſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as thoſe three tribes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of Iſrael, which were beyond Iordan, were carried away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captiuitie by Teglathphalaſar king of the Aſſyrians 2 King. 15. ver. 29. Secondly, when as the tribes which were left of the ſame
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:9718:329"/>kingdome, were by Salmanaſar king of the ſayd Aſſyrians carried into Media 2. King. 17. ve. 3.6. when as, I ſay, theſe troubles and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries fell out vnto the people of Iſrael (which was the ſeede of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, that ſame peculiar people of God) and that from God, by what meanes (aske the men that are hypocrites, vngodly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane or wicked) may God bee ſayd to intreate his ſonnes more gently then his enemies? And ſo conſequently they indifferently ſcorned and mocked theſe threatnings of God againſt the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and alſo his promiſes towards his elect, to bee ſhort, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly deſpiſed the whole word of God, and ſayd that it was vaine, and had no trueth in it. God anſwereth, that theſe things fell out vnto the Iſraelites for the ſelfe ſame cauſe,<note place="margin">The anſwer of God vnto the former obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the vngodlie and hypocrites.</note> for the which he would deſtroy the Aſſyrians, to wit, becauſe the Iſraelites would neuer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God, nor keepe the peace and couenant made with him: but through thoſe their moſt wicked counſels were at enimitie with God. And therefore imagined to haue blotted out the glorie of God, and finallie deuiſed moſt lewd things againſt Iehouah, like as the Aſſyrians doe. Wherefore for this cauſe the Iſraelites were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, much leſſe therefore ſhall the Aſſyrians ſcape ſcotfree. For if theſe things be done in the greene tree, what ſhall be done in the drie? Otherwiſe God would haue handled the Iſraelites moſt gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, if they would haue done their duetie, and haue ſtood to their couenants with God, &amp; haue kept peace with him. For they ſhould haue remained many, and a great multitude, and ſhould not haue been broken, and leſſened, and almoſt deſtroyed, as they then were, and now are. But this haue the Iſraelites deſerued becauſe of their euill counſailes againſt the Lord, and therefore hath it thus fallen out vnto them. Wherefore much more ſhall the ſame come to paſſe vnto the Aſſyrians, <hi>They ſhould haue been cropped,</hi> and skoured only: but not cut off, deſtroyed, flayed, as they now are.

                     <p>He addeth, <hi>I would indeed haue afflicted them:</hi> yet but once, and only to heale them; not twiſe: or I would not haue ſtrooken them againe, and afreſh, as I haue done, as it were to deſtroy them, that is, of a purpoſe to deſtroy them.

For as much then as the forces of the kingdome of the Aſſyrians were ſo great, and the ſame fearfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men in that age, when as according vnto man it ſeemed a thing eaſie vnto none, that ſo mighty an Empire, ſo large and wide, vpholden with ſo great wealth, ſhould notwithſtanding bee caſt downe by the power of men: God by ſuch an <hi>hypotypoſis</hi> or liuely deſcription as is ſet downe in this whole chapter ſheweth, that this is not onely eaſie and ready vnto him, but alſo layeth downe the meanes and way (which was to come) of performing and executing the ſame, both to comfort the godly and his people, which were afflicted by them: and alſo to terrifie or make afraide the vngodly, and the Aſſyrians, vnto whom nothing can bee ſafe, God being wroth and angry with them.</p>

For <hi>Herodotus in Polymn.</hi> or <hi>libr.</hi> 7. wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that the Chaldees in warres vſed this kinde of weapon, as alſo ſhieldes and ſpeares. Doubtles the Prophet Iſai writeth that the Empire of the Aſſyrians was chiefly deſtroyed by the Chaldees, cap 23. verſ 13. <hi>Beholde</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the land of the Chaldeans: this was no people: Aſſhur founded it by the inhabitants of the wildernes:

For I thinke the ſame comparing of Niniueh with a poole of water, to appertaine hereunto, namely, that it may bee vnderſtood that there was in that citie both plentie of all things needfull to liue withall, and alſo great eaſines to get a liuing.

The heart therefore of the fighters for Niniueh ſhall melt and vaniſh away, ſo that they ſhall vtterly be out of hope that it may be preſerued by them. And the ſignes and tokens of this their deſpaire (for Niniueh was taken, not ſo much through fault or want of munitions, as betrayed, that is, not defended, through a ſuddain feare, where with they were ſtriken that ſhould haue defended it.)

Nemrod, by whom this Empire is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to haue been firſt founded, is called <hi>a mighty hunter,</hi> Gen. 10. ve. 9. becauſe that he was both cruell vnto other men, and alſo gotte booties and prayes from other nations. For after this ſort hee firſt framed and ordered his rule bearing: the which courſe and manner of liuing and rule bearing it is likely that his ſucceſſours followed afterwards. Finally, when as there was no feare of the true GOD among thoſe nations, what elſe was that ſame Empire of the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, albeit that it ſtretched neuer ſo farre and wide, but a great the euery? For ſayth Auguſtine, what elſe are great Empires with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iuſtice, but great the eueries? Whereupon that ſame Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great,<note place="margin">Lucanus.</note> is by Lucanus called the Great theefe of the worlde. And ſurely a people can hardly ariſe vp, and get dominion ouer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers without great force, iniurie, violence, and robbery, the which muſt be done vnto other nations. For it muſt needes be, that ſuch a dominion muſt increaſe by the falles and ruines of other nations, as firſt, of thoſe which are neere and adioyning vnto it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of others farther off. Such therefore were the Kings of the Aſſyrians alſo. Wherefore they are worthylie called Lyons: and their ſonnes Lyons whelpes: their houſes, Caues and dennes of Lyons: laſtly, their goods by them heaped together, booties and ſpoyles. And with the ſame puniſhment, wherewith the Aſſyrian kings are puniſhed, ſhal thoſe kings &amp; princes alſo at this day be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:9718:339"/>by God, which in maners and nature are like vnto the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and rauenous and cruel lyons.

This ſelfe ſame thing doth Cicero confirme <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Diuinat.</hi> which fetcheth it, and the authoritie of it from the Aſſyrians, as the firſt inuentors of it. Laſtly it is apparant by Iſai cap. 2. ver. 6. and cap. 47. ver. 13. that the Eaſt people, among whom doubtles are the Aſſyrians, were the finders out of al forbidden Diuination, that is, Aſtrologicall, Magicall, and all ſuch other Diuinations. And theſe are two notorious crimes, with the which the true knowledge and worſhip of God was vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aboliſhed and done away, namely, idolatrie and witchcraft: the which vices the Aſſyrians ſpred abrode into other nations, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are become guilty of the corrupting of the whole world.

For men do ſorrow with other men ſorrowing in thoſe matters, the which we may conceiue in the feeling and eſtimation of men.

                        </note> and being robbed and ſpoyled of all our goodes to be led into vnknowen landes, to be a ſlaue there, the which is wont to be the condition and caſe of a people caried thus away by enemies from their owne country. The ſecond thing is,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2</hi> The daſhing in peeces of their children.</note> 
                        <hi>The daſhing in peeces of their children</hi> at the heads of all their lanes and ſtreetes. This no doubt was a token of notorious cruelty ſhewed by the enemies againſt the inhabitants of the city No, and a ſigne of exceeding great miſery, and waſted ſtrength of ſo great and mighty a city, when as the fathers were conſtrained to behold and ſuffer their children in ſuch ſort to be torne in peeces, to be ſo daſhed with ſtones, to be ſo cruelly ſlaine and murthered, and to ſuffer and let them lie ſo, as if they had no care of them. The third point is,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>3.</hi> They caſt lottes for the noble men.</note> the moſt honorable perſonages of this city No, were vſed of the enemies like ſlaues, to wit, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they deuided them among them ſelues by lots. Neither did their dignity, nor degree, nor power, nor wealth priuiledge or keepe free the nobles &amp; great men of No from this puniſhment. The fourth token is, <hi>Their great men</hi> alſo <hi>were bound with chaines,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>4</hi> The great and mighty men were bound in chaines.</note> as well as the common ſort &amp; baſeſt of the people. Theſe thinges ought to terrifie or feare both the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuites, which vſed a cruell gouernment, and our ſelues alſo, when as we obey not God: and all princes which are cruell vnto their people: that all men may feare and know that God will be a reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and puniſher of their ſinnes.</p>

For it is likely that they were prouident to foreſee the danger that did growe by fortaine inuaſions, as being warriours, and well exerciſed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſuch matters, when as they knewe by what meanes they themſelues had taken &amp; wonne other lands vnwarded, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times had inuaded or broken in vpon their neighbours think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on no ſuch matter, vnder a colour of ſelling wares vnto them, as Xenophon teacheth in his bookes of the education or bringing vp of Cyrus.

But the Prophet anſwereth that they all at that times ſhall be like vnto locuſtes that flie away, the which in the time of cold do come together in great numbers in the hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: but when the Sunne ariſeth, they vaniſh away by and by &amp; are not to be ſeene, ſo that there appeareth not one of them: neither can their place be knowen. Wherefore by this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon is eaſely vnderſtood, that the confidence or truſt of the Niniuites in this behalfe is vaine, and that they ſhall not be defended by their Princes.</p>

All theſe ſortes and kindes of Inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta doe croppe the fields, eate the graſſe, and deuour the corne, hurt the harueſt, and the graine, waſte the fruites, and all leaues of trees. Whereupon <hi>Plinius lib.</hi> 17. <hi>Natur.

                     <p>Now to declare and ſet down how theſe are bred, and ſeuered one from another, appertayneth vnto thoſe that write of naturall matters: but concerning theſe here ſpoken of, I doe iudge that they were made at that time by God after an extraordinary maner, both in reſpect of the number of them, and alſo of this their ſuch power and ſo great deuouring &amp; eating vp of things. Neither was this famine cauſed and brought forth in foure diuers and continual yeares (namely, in the firſt yeare by the palmer worme, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond yeare by the locuſt, and ſo forth) but I thinke that all theſe were together, and came in one and the ſame yeare, and cauſed the famine.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſuch as is in this place proclaimed. And in regard of out ſelues it is required, namely, that being well prepared, yea euen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the outward forme, we doe turne vnto God, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly repent.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For the ſecond, theſe publike prayers were to bee made by the Prieſts, as namely the publike miniſters of GOD in the Temple. For this belongeth vnto them by the right of their office peculiarly committed vnto them by God: like as it doth alſo at this day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine vnto the miniſters of the word of GOD, or the paſtors of the Church. Furthermore, albeit in this place the prieſts are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly named who were to conceiue the praiers, becauſe this whole congregation is deſcribed in ſuch ſorte as it ought to be at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem) yet might other Leuites alſo, which were not Prieſts, in other cities and Synagogues of Iudah conceiue prayers for the people in the ſolemne dayes of faſt. For the ſelfe ſame ſimple Leuites, that is, ſuch as were Leuites onely, and not Prieſts, not onely might, but alſo in regard of their office ought publikely to expound the word of God it ſelfe, vnto the which the prayers are adioyned, as certain hangbies, or additions and partes of the ſame. Wherefore it is not the part of euery one to ſpeak publikely in the Church, and to pray, and miniſter the ſacraments, but it belongeth vnto the Church offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. For 1. Cor. 14. ver. 34. Paul <hi>will haue women to keepe ſilence in the Churches.</hi> And 1. Tim. 2. ver. 1. <hi>He willeth that ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions, and giuing of thanks be made for all men.</hi>

So then this armie, which was gathered together out of the Northren countries (for both the Aſſyrians and alſo the Chaldees were ſituated vnto the Iewes Northrenly, or toward the North) ſhall be ſcattered or driuen away, namely, one part of them vnto the South, or into a drie land: for the drie countrie is South vnto the Iewes. The other part of them, or the firſt band of them ſhall be driuen into the Eaſt. The latter into the Weſt. Theſe things came to paſſe, not only when as God ouerthrew the Monarchie or Empire of the Babylonians, that is of the Chaldees by the Perſians, but alſo when as the power of the Babylonians to take Syria, and conſequently to inuade Iewrie,<note place="margin">In that place of the Kings there is no mention made of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians but of the Aſsyrians.</note> was ſcattered by King Necao, 2. King. cap. 23. ver. 29. Concerning the ouerthrow of the Chaldees by the Medes or Perſians (for they are often taken the one for the other) thus the Lord threatneth by his Prophet Iſai cap. 13. ver. 17. <hi>Behold, I will ſtirre vp the Medes againſt them, which ſhall not regard ſiluer, nor be deſirous of gold. And Babel the glorie of Kingdomes, the beautie and pride of the Chaldeans, ſhall be as the deſtruction of God in Sodom, and Gomorah.</hi> The place of Iſai cap. 31. ver. 8. propheſieth of the deſtruction of the kingdome of the Aſſyrians in theſe words: <hi>Then ſhall Aſſhur fall by the ſword, not of man, neither ſhall the ſword of man deuoure him, and he ſhall flee from the ſword, and his yong men ſhall faint.</hi> But cap. 48. ver. 20. the Iewes are willed to get them out
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:9718:370"/>of Babel, and to flee from the Chaldeans, whereby is ſignified the ouerthrow of that citie by the Perſians, from the which the people of God are willed to flee, leſt by tarrying they ſhould be partakers of their plagues.</p>

Secondlie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the minde and meaning of God was, that if the Iewes would not wholy ſcape the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, at leaſtwiſe they ſhuld not in ſuch ſort prouoke God, that he ſhould not onelie be content with thoſe light puniſhments, wherewith he had corrected them before: but muſt adde alſo thereunto the ouerthrow and deſtruction of the citie it ſelfe, the place, and Countrie wherein they dwelled, vnto the ſhewing of the which puniſhment vpon them, they draue God in the end.

So great certes is the benefit of God toward his Church by and for Chriſt, ſo great is his loue, and ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable and mercifull is he. <hi>For in Chriſt,</hi> as Paul writeth Epheſ. 1. ver. 3.4. <hi>hath God bleſſed vs with all ſpirituall bleſſing in heauenly things, as he hath choſen vs in him, before the foundation of the world, &amp;c.</hi> And as it is Coloſ. 1. ver. 22. <hi>In the bodie of his fleſh through death hath he now reconciled vs, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, as for regeneration of life, the ſame alſo is deſcribed in this place both by things going before, and alſo by things following.<note place="margin">

Whereby appeareth that this propheſie went not long before thoſe times, wherein thoſe things which are here threatned, came to paſſe, and wee haue ſayd alreadie. Further, this worke, is the ruſhing &amp; breaking in of the Chaldeans into the land of Iewrie, and the deſtruction of Ieruſalem. For theſe euen at that time did God ordaine and prepare to bee the executioners of the people of the Iewes, and the reuengers of the contemning or deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his name. Concerning this matter, ſee Ierem. 5. Alſo Ierem. 13. ver. 20. and 21. the are willed to enter into the conſideration of theſe things in theſe words: <hi>Lift vp your eyes, and behold them that come from the North: where is the flocke that was giuen thee, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thy beautifull flocke? what wilt thou ſay, when he ſhall viſite thee?

                     <p>Furthermore, God did thus prepare the Chaldeans vnto this
<pb n="870" facs="tcp:9718:415"/>Empire began to ariſe vp, and gathered ſtrength and power:<note place="margin">The Chaldeans growing in ſtrength and power, might the more eaſilie execute God his iudgements againſt the Iewes.</note> for ſo by this meanes it did the more eaſilie execute thoſe iudgements of God againſt the Iewes. Thoſe increaſings therefore of the Empire of the Chaldeans (the which at that time began to waxe very great among other nations neere vnto them) were as a gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and making readie of rods, the which God would vſe to whip his people withall. And the Iewes are willed to marke this, &amp; that very dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, becauſe that within ſhort time afterward they were to be puniſhed, and ſharply corrected by thoſe Chaldeans. So in the times of our Elders, when as God rayſed vp the Empire of the Turkes, all the Chriſtians ought to ſet their eyes thereupon, as on whippes,<note place="margin">The kingdome of Spaine likely to be a whip to correct the ſins of the profeſsors of the Goſpell.</note> the which God ordained for them. So if any idolatrous kingdome (ſuch as is that of Spaine) in God his will and purpoſe do afterward gather great increaſe, let vs Chriſtians and the faithfull take it, as if euen now there were by God ordayned correctors of our ſinnes, and of the nought ſetting by the doctrine of the Goſpell, and fearfull reuengers of the deſpiſed name of God. Wherefore let men that are Chriſtians, at the leaſt now at length begin to abſtain from their ſinnes, and with ſpeede and earneſtly turne vnto the true God, when as they ſee theſe things to be done, and to be in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by God in the word.</p>

                           <hi>1.</hi> Looke how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies and in how manie places the Church hath, ſo manie reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and out of ſo many places, God hath in readines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</note> out of how

Further, this repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby their crueltie, and the trembling of the Church is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine deſcribed in this ſelfe ſame chapter, ſerueth vnto this ende, leaſt the godly might ſuppoſe that God were too weake againſt ſuch enemies, and leaſt they ſhould meaſure his power &amp; ſtrength by their owne feare, and ſo conſequently it ſerueth, that the godlie ſhould ceaſe to tremble at the power and might of men, bee they neuer ſo fierce, and terrifying or awhaping others.

Therefore theſe things are done in the fauour of Chriſt, to wit, that his people, inheritance, and ſeate decreed, and ordained by God, might be reſerued vnto him.

And therefore Iohn ſayth cap. 1. ver. 17. <hi>The law was giuen by Moſes, but grace and trueth came by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> And the word of exhortation <hi>(Behold)</hi> ſheweth that the

                           <hi>2</hi> A deſcription of Chriſt.</note> Secondly, this ſame promiſe containeth a deſcription of Chriſt, that wee ſhould conſider how great a benefite of God he is: and ſhould not thinke this to be as a ſimple gift, or ſome common and meane thing. And Chriſt is called the <hi>ſeruant of God,</hi> to wit, in reſpect that he was made man. And yet not a ſeruant after the maner of the reſt of the faithfull, the which in many things obey not the Lord their God, Malach. 1. but he is ſo called by a certaine excellencie. For he was in euery reſpect to fulfill all the will of God his father, and indeed in that he was man, he fulfilled the ſame Iſai. 61. Moreouer, he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>branch,</hi> as hereafter cap. 6. ver. 12. <hi>Behold the man, whoſe name is the branch, and he ſhall growe vp out of his place, and he ſhall build the temple of the Lord.</hi> So Iſai 11. ver. 1. <hi>But there ſhall come a rod forth of the ſtocke of Iſhai, and a graffe ſhall grow out of his rootes.</hi> Likewiſe God ſayth in Ieremie cap. 23. ver. 5. <hi>Behold, the dayes come, ſayth the Lord, that I will raiſe vnto Dauid a righteous branch, and a King ſhall reigne, and proſper, and ſhal execute iudgement &amp; iuſtice in the earth.</hi> And he is termed a <hi>branch,</hi> not ſo much for that his condition and ſtate is baſe,<note place="margin">Why Chriſt is called a branch</note> and here deſcribed vnto vs meane and ſimple in the iudgement of men, as for that he ſhould alone be vnderſtood of vs to bee the fountaine, roote, and ſpring of the whole Church. And therefore that he alone is he, by whoſe power, and Spirit, and word we are plants and trees in the Church of God: becauſe he is he, of whom alone, as of a ſpirituall branch wee all are borne againe, and made heauenly plants. For as Iames witneſſeth cap. 1. ve. 18. <hi>Of his owne will begat he vs with the word of trueth, that we ſhould be as the firſt fruites of his creatures.</hi> And Peter Epiſt. 1. cap. 1. ver. 23. teacheth vs likewiſe, <hi>that we are borne a new, not of mortall ſeede, but of immortall, by the word of God, who liueth and endureth for euer.</hi> Which thing doubtles agreeth vnto Chriſt alone, into whom wee muſt be graffed, that we may be borne ſpirituallie, and be heauenly branches, Iohn 15.</p>

Therfore he confirmeth the former conſequence or reaſon by the Epithets or proper attributes or titles of Chriſt, and of this branch, that we ſhould without doubting looke for all things from God by and for Chriſt. And, that Chriſt is the foundation of the Church, the word <hi>ſtone</hi> doth declare, whereby Chriſt is here termed, not by contempt, or in deſpite, but by his name, as Pſalm. 118. ver. 22. <hi>The ſtone which the builders refuſed, is the head of the corner.</hi> And I ſai 28. ver. 16. <hi>Behold, I will lay in Zion a ſtone, a tried ſtone, a precious corner ſtone, a ſure foundation.

And this viſion is taken from things moſt known among the Iewes in that age, to wit, from that Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke, the which was lighted with candles in the Temple of God, and was an ordinarie inſtrument of the outward ſeruice of God, &amp; a part of the olde ceremonies and ſuch as were familiar vnto the Iewes, or whereunto they were vſed, &amp; with the which they were very well acquainted. For albeit that this Candleſticke which is here by viſion ſhewed vnto the Prophet, doth in this poynt ſeeme to differ from the Candleſticke of the Temple, ſuch as is deſcribed Exod. 25. becauſe that this had one onely bowle, and that of the Temple ſeuen bowles: yet this is but a ſmall difference. But herein it was behouefull that the forme of this ſhould be diuers from that Candleſticke of the lawe, that it might the more eaſilie be ſhewed vnto vs, that whatſoeuer falleth out, is done or ordered in the Church, the ſame is done by the one Spirit of God, and not by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: and needeth not diuers authors, but one God onely.<note place="margin">Why God ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth this viſion vnto his Church.</note> And this firſt verſe ſheweth, why God by his Prophet propoundeth or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth this viſion vnto his church, namely to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme, or ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and comfort the ſame, the which was rather aſtoniſhed with the wondring at the former promiſes, then did beleeue them: and was rather made aſtonied and brought as it were into a trance, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> comforted. Therefore this ſleepe, from which the Prophet ſayth he was raiſed, is the trance, and wondring of amazednes, or an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonied minde, not the ſleepe of ſleeping or ſlumbring, and ſleepe of the bodie. So the ſame fell out vnto Daniel cap. 8. ver. 17.18. where he confeſſeth that he was afrayd at the viſion, and fell vpon his face, and being aſleepe fell vpon his face vnto the ground. And ver. 27. he ſayth that he was not only aſtoniſhed at the viſion, but alſo was ſtriken and ſicke certaine dayes. And cap. 10. ver. 8.9.10. he affirmeth that at the viſion, which was there ſhewed vnto him alone, the men that were with him ran away for great feare, and hid themſelues, and that he for his part was ſo weakened, and brought ſo low, that there remained no ſtrength in him, for that his ſtrength
<pb n="952" facs="tcp:9718:461"/>was turned into corruption, and that he reteined no power, yea that he was thereby made ſo feeble, that he was not able to ſtand, vntill he was ſet vp vpon his knees, and vpon the palmes of his hands, by the man that talked with him, &amp;c. And that which the Prophet in this place ſaith to haue fallen out vnto himſelfe, wee are to thinke the like alſo of other godly men, albeit they feare God, and truſt in him neuer ſo much, namelie that they were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brought into a wonderment, then confirmed or ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: becauſe that all things, the which they then ſawe round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, tooke from them all hope of the fulfilling of theſe promiſes in time to come.

For the Church of God is the true light of the world, which ſhineth before all men, Matth. 5. Pſalm. 72. God therefore of his ſurpaſſing goodnes, and of his infinite wiſedome, and wonderfull prouidence towards his Church, doth ſo diſpoſe and order all things, that ſhe neuer wanteth thoſe things which are neceſſarie for her, albeit men ſuppoſe her to lacke theſe things, becauſe that they looke only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Now, whereas the Prophet maketh mention onely of two oliue trees, the reaſon is, becauſe they were enough to miniſter oyle vnto that candle, when as they did miniſter it on both ſides, the one on the right hand, and the other on the left hand.

Wherefore when as God doth execute it, he ſheweth the force and trueth of his law, or word written, and ratifieth the authoritie thereof. Secondly, this booke flieth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> becauſe that the Lord is angrie not onely with one people, or ſinfull nation of the world, but withal the ſinful nations of the world.

For wee doe goe forward by little and little, in the beholding and perceiuing of the workes of God, and doe by little and little profit in the ſame: and doe not out of hand, and at one inſtant conceiue and vnderſtand all things. That therefore which is here firſt ſhewed vnto the Prophet, is diligently and earneſtly to be beholden, It is an Epha, or a buſhell. For in this place this word is generally taken, the which notwithſtanding among the Hebrues hath the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is a kinde of a certaine meaſure. For this Epha was to be ſo big, that it might receiue and hold a whole woman, or a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man vpright, and ſtanding in it: or elſe ſitting and leaning, or lying a ſide.<note place="margin">The interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this viſion of the Epha.</note> The interpretation is ſet downe afterward. And this Epha went forth, and moued, and ſtood not in one place, but did flye through the whole earth. The interpretation is this, that by this figure is ſhewed, that the eye of the Lord doth ſee all wicked perſons, or all wickednes and vngodlines, the which, as I ſaide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, flieth and rangeth vp and downe in the whole world.

For God will not, that according vnto the deſire thereof, it ſhall rage, and breake
<pb n="967" facs="tcp:9718:468"/>through, whether ſoeuer it liſteth. <hi>For the rod of the wicked</hi> (as it is Pſalm. 125. ver. 3.) <hi>ſhall not rest on the lot of the righteous, least the righteous put forth their hand vnto wickednes.</hi> And this eye of God, or this Epha, or buſhell is moued and flieth, as wickednes it ſelfe is moued, and flieth: that we ſhould know aſſuredly, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can eſcape that vnſleepie eye of God, or eye that neuer ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth. For as Dauid ſaith, Pſalm 121. ver. 4. <hi>He that keepeth Iſrael, will neither ſlumber nor ſleepe.</hi> And as the writer to the Hebrues af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth cap. 4. ver. 13. <hi>There is no creature, which is not manifest in his ſight: but all things are naked and open vnto his eyes, with whom we haue to doe.</hi> Nothing therefore is hid from his eyes or ſight, but all the wicked whereſoeuer they lye hidden, and in what place of the world ſoeuer they be, are found out, taken, and ſeene of it. So then, God, ſo farre forth as pleaſeth him, and as he ſeeth to be meete, and expedient, dooth repreſſe and keepe back the wicked, not only in his church, becauſe he is not onely the keeper and preſeruer of his church: but alſo in all places of the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that he alſo is the keeper and preſeruer of all mankinde, and of the ſocietie or fellowſhip of man.

For both chariots, eſpecially ſuch as goe with foure wheeles, and Spirits are things moſt ſwift and ſpeedie. Wherefore they are not ſlowe, but forthwith doe performe, and bring to paſſe that thing, which God will haue to be done by them. So 2. King. cap. 19. ver. 35.

For God by that his heauenly prouidence doth rule all and euery thing in euery part of the world. For as it is Pſal. 105. ver. 7. <hi>He is the Lord our God: his

Now alſo euen vnder the Goſpell Kings and Princes are brought vnto Chriſt, and there may bee ſeene an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward glorie of the true Church of God, how great ſoeuer it be, Pſal. 72.

For this King (of whoſe comming the Prophet ſaith that they are to reioyce) is indued with iuſtice, whereby he ſhall euery where ſet downe lawfull and good order,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>3.</hi> The cauſe of the ſame.</note> he ſhall take away things diſordered, keepe back violence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> defend
<pb n="1024" facs="tcp:9718:497"/>the good: and he is alſo indued with ſaluation, whereby he will deliuer thoſe that are his out of dangers. And for as much as this King was and is Chriſt the Meſſias, the true and euerlaſting King and keeper of his Church, he is ſaid to be indued with ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and iuſtice, in reſpect that he is a man: and not in reſpect that he is God. For in reſpect that he is God, he hath both theſe of himſelfe, and not of any other.

Therefore here is now deſcribed, what maner of Shepheardes the ordinarie Shepheards were.

                        </note> as their moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious goodes. For euen then, when as they doe this, they are not counted guiltie, or eſteemed ſo by others.

Sam. 8. from the eleuenth verſe vnto the 18. wherein is ſhewed that hee ſhall make their ſonnes his horſe men, and chariot driuers, his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, his plow men, his harueſters, his ſmithes, and ſuch like: their daughters, his apothecaries, and cookes, and bakers: that hee will take away their goodes, and giue them vnto his nobles, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie vſe them euery way moſt ſeruilelie and ſlauiſhlie.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Couetous.</hi>

For
<pb n="1052" facs="tcp:9718:511"/>they ſay, bleſſed be the Lord, who hath giuen vs theſe thinges. So doth Chriſt accuſe the Phariſes of his time, and Shepheardes of the Iewes, who reteined theſe maners brought in, and accuſtomed of long time, Matth. 23. ver 14. where hee cryeth woe vnto them for the ſame, ſaying, <hi>Woe bee vnto you Scribes and Phariſes, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites: for ye deuoure widdowes houſes, euen vnder a colour of long prayers: wherefore yee ſhall receiue the greater damnation.</hi> This that is here ſaid of their couetouſnes to haue been true, appeareth by the hiſtorie of the Iewes in <hi>Aristobulus, Antipater, Herod,</hi> and in all the reſt, alſo in the Prieſtes, which vntill the time of the deſtruction of Ieruſalem were their Kinges and Shepheards, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph.</hi>

                        <hi>in Antiquitat. lib. 13. &amp; de Bello Iudaico lib. 2.</hi> Thirdly, they were Hypocrites. For they goe about to hide and couer their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crileges or notorious robberies, their making marchandiſe of the people, and their prayes and booties, with the holy name of God, as with a vaile. So ſpeaketh Chriſt of the ordinarie Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards of the Church of his time Matth. 23. ver. 15.16.23. <hi>Woe be vnto you, Scribes and Phariſes, Hypocrites: for yee compaſſe ſea, and land to make one of your profeſſion: and when hee is made, yee make him twofold more the childe of hell then your ſelues.

Theſe ought ye to haue done, and not to haue left the other.</hi> So alſo doth Peter deſcribe or ſet foorth the Popiſh Clergie, in his ſecond epiſtle, cap. 2. ver. 3.10.14. after this maner: <hi>Through couetouſnes ſhall they with fained wordes make marchandiſe of you, whoſe iudgement long agone is not farre off, and their damnation ſleepeth not, chiefely them that walke after the fleſh, in the lust of vncleannes, and despiſe the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, which are preſumptuous, and ſtand in their owne conceit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <note place="margin">They are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of their charge and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note>

<pb n="1053" facs="tcp:9718:511"/>For theſe ſhepheards are not touched with any affection or loue at all toward the ſheepe of GOD committed vnto them.

<pb n="1055" facs="tcp:9718:512"/>So then the true and wholſome gouerning of that people conſiſted firſt in bringing againe of true order, to wit, in purging the pure do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the word of God deliuered vnto them, from all ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and in the reſtoring of other things (whereby the excellencie of this people aboue others, and their order in religion, and in policie appeared) and alſo in the preſeruing of the moſt ſtraite vnion and agreement of that whole people within themſelues, and that forme and rule appoynted by God. Wherefore the Prophet repreſenting the perſon of Chriſt, ſheweth that he alſo was deſirous, and tooke vpon him the care of reſtoring of this gouernment, and deliuering it vnto them. And this doth he declare by two ſignes moſt fit to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the ſame. For he ſayth that he tooke vnto him two roddes, or ſhepheards hookes: the one, which he called <hi>Beautie,</hi> or <hi>Comlines,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Beautie.</note> to wit, of the ſignification of the thing which it ſignified: the other, he named <hi>Cordes,</hi> or <hi>Bands,</hi> and <hi>fellowſhip,</hi> namely, of the ende,<note place="margin">Bands.</note> and ſignification of the thing, whereof it was a ſigne and figure. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as appeareth hereafter, ver. 15. God by the conſideration of the ſheephooke and ſigne (the which the Prophet as a ſhepheard took vnto him) would haue it ſhewed vnto his people as it were by a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, what maner of ſhepheards he then would giue, and alſo what maner of ſhepheard he himſelfe would be vnto that people. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that rod, which is called Beautie and Comelines,<note place="margin">What was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the rod Beautie.</note> was a ſigne of that ſame whole order, truth, and forme or beautie, the which God went about to reſtore vnto them both in true religion, and alſo in true policie, whereby the fairenes, comlines, and beautie of that ſtate did ſhine forth. This excellencie and beautie of the ſtate of the Iewes aboue al other nations, Moſes doth liuely expreſſe Deut. 4. ver. 6.7.8. in theſe words: <hi>Keepe them therefore, and doe them:</hi> (he ſpeaketh of the lawes and ordinances, which God had giuen vnto them) <hi>for that is your wiſedome, and your vnderſtanding in the ſight of the people, which ſhall heare all theſe ordinances, and ſay, onely this people is wiſe, and of vnderſtanding, and a great nation. For what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo great, vnto whom the gods come ſo neere vnto them, as the Lord our God is neere vnto vs, in all that we call vnto him for? And what nation is ſo great, that hath ordinances, and lawes ſo righteous, as all this law, which I ſet before you this day?</hi> The ſecond rod, which is called <hi>Bands,</hi> was a ſigne of that vnion or agreement,<note place="margin">What is ment by the rodde Bands.</note> both in true faith, and alſo in the politike order ordained by God, the which God procured alſo to bee done in this whole nation, Pſal. 133. but in vaine. And in theſe two poynts is contained that ſame firſt part
<pb n="1056" facs="tcp:9718:513"/>of wholſome gouernment, the which is called due and lawfull, and right order. And for this cauſe are theſe things ſayd ſo diligently to be procured by God, that wee ſhould vnderſtand that the cauſe of the deſtruction, and ruine of this people doth not lye, nor is in God, but in both the ſhepheards, and alſo the people.</p>

<pb n="1059" facs="tcp:9718:514"/>and therefore that this was the word of God, and true. For the falling out of the matter accordingly, is a moſt true witnes of the propheſies of God. This place agreeth with that ſaying of Chriſt, Matth. 11. ver. 19. <hi>The wiſedome of God is iustified of her children.</hi> And this chiefely came then to paſſe, when as all the godlie Iewes after the death and aſcenſion of Chriſt, when warres began to growe, departed all from Ieruſalem and went to Pella, as Euſebius witneſſeth, lib 3.

In the verſe following is added the third note, namely, the flying away of the ſhepheard, by the which he forſaketh and leaueth his flocke, as Iohn witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth cap 10. ver. 12. <hi>An hireling and he that is not the ſhepheard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſheepe are his owne, ſeeth the wolfe comming, and he leaueth the ſheepe, and flyeth, and the wolfe catcheth them, and ſcattereth the ſheepe.</hi> The negligence of theſe ſhepheards is in feeding: their crueltie in deuouring, and alſo in killing their flocke. And the negligence of ſhepheardes is not of one ſort,<note place="margin">Foure poynts of a negligent ſhepheard.</note> but manifold. For here are reckoned vp foure ſortes of it. For the whole flocke, or euery particular member thereof, or moe members, doe either ſtand, or elſe haue fallen alreadie, or are likely to fall by and by: and moreouer they are either hole and ſound, or elſe hurt and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Wherefore God ſheweth in all theſe poyntes what is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of good ſhepheards, that on the contrarie part, they may bee vnderſtood, who are bad, and negligent ſhepheardes. As for that flocke,<note place="margin">

Of

And by the word <hi>prayer,</hi> he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth a godly minde, and acknowledging God, and grounded in faith, and the which in afflictions hath recourſe vnto God, not vnto idols, or men, and giueth thankes vnto him for benefites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.

Yet if any man will applie theſe things which follow, vnto the mourning and lamenting of the Church (the which bewailed Chriſt treacherouſlie and cruellie condemned and put to death Luc. 23. ver. 27. where hee reporteth that <hi>there followed him a great multitude of people, and of women, which wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men bewailed and lamented him,</hi>) it may very well fitte, and agree thereunto. For all the deliuerers of Iſrael were a type or figure of Chriſt the true Captaine and redeemer of his Church. But firſt of all, theſe things doe belong according vnto the letter, vnto that mourning the which the Iewes made partlie for Mathathias, and partlie for Iudas the Machabees 1. Mich. 9. ver. 20.21. Ioſep. lib. 12. Antiquit. in the laſt chapter, being moſt like vnto that mourning, the which they had made before for Ioſias 2. Chr. 35. ver. 24.25. This mourning therefore hee deſcribeth or ſetteth forth, both by the outward pompe, and alſo by the inward ſorrow. For the Prophet hath comprehended them both. By the worde <hi>(Saphad)</hi> is declared the outward pompe and funerall rites: and by the word <hi>(Hamer)</hi> the ſorrow of the minde, or true heauines. Furthermore hee deſcribeth the ſaide mourning by a ſimilitude, or compariſon of moſt lamentable ſorrowing. For (ſaith hee) the Iewes ſhall in ſuch ſorte bewaile him as pittifull and tender hearted parents, are wont to lament their onely ſonne taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them by death.</p>

Deut. 13. ver. 9. <hi>Thou ſhalt euen kill him</hi> (ſaith God in that place) <hi>thine hand ſhall be firſt vpon him to put him to death, &amp; then the hands of all the people.</hi> And that which here is ſet downe in precept, ſeemeth by Moſes to bee teſtified of the children of Leui, that it was performed in action, when they drew their ſwords at the commandement of God, and ſlew euery man his brother in the reuenge of the great idolatrie which was committed, in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the golden Calfe, whereunto he alludeth Deut. 33. ver. 9. ſaying: <hi>Who ſayd vnto his father, and vnto his mother, I haue not ſeene him, neither knewe he his brethren, nor knewe his owne children:</hi> (meaning that he ſlew all, without partialitie) <hi>for they obſerued thy word, and kept thy couenant.</hi> For wee ought to loue GOD more then our owne children.

Yet neuertheleſſe doth not this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe thoſe from puniſhment, who when as they doe not take vpon them the name of a Shepheard in the Church, yet do they notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſowe and ſpread abroad lyes and errors. For it is all one, when as a man doth teach falſhood and hereſie, whether he giue himſelfe out to be called, or doe not giue himſelfe out ſo to be.

For he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how the Lord will cauſe that third part to be left, and will preſerue the ſame, namely, through the middeſt of afflictions or troubles.

                           <hi>1.</hi> A propheſie of the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the church.</note> a propheſie, as I ſaid, of the afflictions, which were to come, which are ſignified by the name of fire. Secondly, the maner, meaſure, and order of the ſame: namely, they ſhall not conſume the Church, but ſhall purge it, like as the fire purgeth gold and ſiluer from the droſſe,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> What they ſhall worke in the ſame.</note> and trieth it. Afflictions doe ſwallow vp the vngodly, and doe deuoure them: but they onely trie the good, and make the elect of God more pure. So Peter 1. Epiſt cap. 1. ver. 7. Teacheth that many tentations fell out vnto the godly, <hi>That the triall of their faith being much more precious then gold, which periſheth (though it be tried with fire) might bee found vnto their prayſe, and honor, and glorie, at the comming of Christ.</hi> And GOD ſaith of his Church Iſai 48. ver. 10. <hi>Behold, I haue fined thee, but not as ſiluer, I haue choſen thee in the fornace of affliction.</hi> Whereby appeareth how profitable affliction is vnto the Church. <hi>It is good that thou hast humbled mee, and brought mee downe,</hi> ſaith Dauid, Pſalm. 119. ver. 71. The third thing is, what confirmation of faith ſhall growe by this affliction,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>3.</hi> What confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of faith ſhall growe by theſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> namely, that then the Church ſhall come neere vnto God, and ſhall call vpon him: and againe God himſelfe ſhall more clearelie ſhew himſelfe vnto her, and ſhall heare her prayers and requeſtes. Finallie, he ſhall then giue more aſſured teſtimonies or witneſſes vnto the Church her ſelfe of his couenant with his Church, the which ſhe ſhall acknowledge, and follow, and therefore ſhall anſwer GOD, when he calleth her. Wherefore the calling vpon God, and the acknowledging of him as a father, is greater, and more certaine in the godly in the time of affliction, then in the time of proſperitie, becauſe that in the happie ſucceſſe of things we are wont to be ſecure or careles: but in trouble wee ſhewe our ſelues more obedient vnto the holy Ghoſt, drawing this fruite out of afflictions, as it were light out of darkenes. For albeit (as it is Hebrewes 12. verſe 11.) <hi>no afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bee pleaſant for the preſent time, but grieuous, yet afterward it bringeth the quiet fruite of righteouſnes vnto them, which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by exerciſed.</hi>

Therefore looke in what place their Ancetours ſome fourtie yeares before tooke Chriſt, and brought him vnto moſt cruell torments, in the ſelfe ſame place God himſelfe ſtood to puniſh them moſt ſharplie, and as they had deſerued, moſt hardlie, Iohn 18. Matth. 26. ver. 30. where it is expreſſed how Chriſt went with his Diſciples after the eating of the Paſchal Lamb, vnto Mount Oliuet, where he was taken. Secondly, the caſting downe,<note place="margin">The fitting of this mount Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet for the vſe and turne of the enemies.</note> or the breaking and digging of this mountaine of Oliues, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it fit for the vſe and turne of the enemies, is to be noted. For the ſouldiars that beſieged the citie ſhall digge it through, that there may be left a great valley in the middeſt betweene both partes of the mountaine ſo digged, that the tentes and garriſons of the enemies planted in that place, might bee the ſafer againſt the aſſaultes, and breakings foorth of the beſieged Iewes. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, this mountaine ſhall bee ſo broken off in the ende, to caſt downe the fortes of the Iewes, and to annoy the citie, that one part of the mountaine ſhall fall toward the South, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther toward the North. The which thing I iudge then to haue been done, when as the Romanes with moſt great labour rayſed vp that ſame wall in three dayes (wherewith they compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the whole citie) and brought it through the middeſt of Mount Oliuet, Ioſeph. lib. 6. cap. 13.

So GOD ſhewed vnto the Niniuites, on what ſide their citie ſhould bee taken, and what at that time ſhould bee the power, and attemptes of the enemies againſt them, Nahum. 2. verſe 6. and cap. 3. and yet neither of theſe repented for all this</p>

Laſtly, they ſhall flee vnto Azal, becauſe that the ſame valley of the Mountaines neere vnto Ieruſalem ſhall reach vnto Azal, and therefore ſhall ſeeme moſt fit for their ſecret fleeing. If there bee any place left for coniectures or geſſes, I doe thinke Azal to be that ſame part of the citie, and holde, the which both was moſt ſafe againſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and alſo moſt fit for to flee vnto, the which by Ioſephus is called Bezeta, concerning the which, Ioſephus himſelfe muſt bee read,<note place="margin">

And the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this trembling is ſet forth by a ſimilitude. For it ſhall bee like vnto the ſame, wherewith the Iewes were ſtrooken of old by reaſon of the earthquake, the which fell out in the dayes of Vzzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the King as we haue ſeene before, Amos cap. 1. ver. 1. This hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie at that time was very well knowne vnto the Iewes. Further,
<pb n="1099" facs="tcp:9718:534"/>by way of an Epiphonema, or acclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the cauſe of this ſo great trembling in this people, is added by the Prophet, to wit, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of God being angrie againſt the Iewes, with thoſe his holy Angels, with the which he ſheweth himſelfe full of maieſtie and feare vnto men, not in any viſible forme: but by extraordinarie effectes, and maruailous, ſo that men muſt then needes tremble, when as God appeareth in ſuch ſort, and ſo terrible or fearefull.

But there ſhall ſucceede this ſo heauie a day or ſtate of theirs in the mercie of God, another day, not altogether cleare and bright vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them at the firſt: but yet more ioyfull then the former, in the euening or latter ende of the which ſecond time and day, a true and full light ſhall ſhine vnto the Iewes, becauſe (as Paul ſaith) the Iewes then, and about the end of the world ſhall be conuerted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt Rom. 11. ver. 25. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I would not, bretheren, that ye ſhould be ignorant of this ſecret (least ye ſhould be arrogant in your ſelues) that partly obstinacie is come to Iſrael, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the fulneſſe of the Gentiles bee come in, and ſo all Iſraell ſhall be ſaued.</hi> So then by the word <hi>(one day)</hi> a certaine and a ſet time is ſignified by God: but a long, and not a ſhort time, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many yeares continuallie, and not the ſpace of 24. houres. And by the adding of theſe wordes <hi>(neither day nor night)</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet betokeneth, a certaine middle ſtate, caſe, and condition, the which is neither in all poyntes to bee wiſhed for, and happie (as is the day) neither yet in all pointes (as is the night) is moſt heauie and lamentable and full of murthers and ſlaughters of the Iewes, as it was before, but ſuch as ſhall be ſomewhat dimme or darke, as the day vſeth for to be in the boblight or twilight, either in the morning or in the euening, when as it is neither fully day, nor ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly darkenes.

And ſuch is now doubtles the nation of the Iewes in all places of the worlde, where they are, neither yet vtterly rooted out, nor yet gathered together, but likevnto the twie light. For it is in a doubt, whether it be a people or no: darke becauſe of their burdens, and yet not cleane put out, through the great mercie, faithfulnes, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God.

For as Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, Matth. 5. ver. 14. <hi>a citie that is ſet on an hill, cannot be hid.</hi> And the place and ſpace from whence it is ſeene, is here deſcribed to be very broade or wide, to wit, from the borders of Beniamin (in the which was Rama, 1. King. 15.) vnto the borders of the tribe of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon (where was Rimmon, Ioſue. 19.) that by this meanes wee ſhould vnderſtand, that the ſight of the Church of God ſhould be euident, and in the view of all nations and people, and not hidden, or vnknowne. Further, as the Church ſhall be reſtored manifeſtly, ſo ſhall it bee reſtored thorowly, and hauing no want in any part thereof: not in the preaching of the word, not in the Sacraments, not in the diſcipline of the Church muſt there bee any thing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. This perfection is ſet forth vnder the figure of the citie hauing all her parts, of the which reade Nehem. cap. 3. There is a like place Reuelat. cap. 21. ver. 18.19. and ſo forth, of the ſpirituall or heauenlie Ieruſalem.</p>

And this doth the Prophet declare by a ſimilitude taken from the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and things well knowne of that time.

In a word, this is the meaning of God, the efficacie, force, and working of the holy Ghoſt ſhall be farre more plentifull through Chriſt in the Church of the Goſpell gathered out of the Gentiles, then it was of olde, and in times paſt vnder the law.
